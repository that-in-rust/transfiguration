- ANTHROPIC_KEY will be the orchestrator and reasoning LLM
- Executive Summary
    - User Segment: Developers on large Rust codebases ONLY
    - Reliability-First Principle:
        - Optimize for accurate 1-go fixes that feel trustworthy and increase user efficacy.
        - Prefer CPU-bound static analysis (rust-analyzer overlays, ISG traversals) and small, local, free subagents.
        - Keep the reasoning LLM as lean and late as possible; minimize context/tokens; use deterministic transforms whenever feasible.
    - Shreyas Doshi (product framing): Prioritize first-apply correctness over speed. Design for clarity, safety, and explicit confidence gating. Time is a secondary outcome.
    - Jeff Dean (systems framing): Make correctness the fast path. Push work to deterministic, cacheable computations (ISG, RA, HNSW). Parallelize retrieval/validation; minimize token movement; measure token-per-fix and cache hit rates.
    - User Promise: “When I hit a Rust bug, the system produces a single-pass, safe, minimal diff that compiles and (when present) passes tests before applying. Speed is a byproduct; correctness is the KPI.”
- Constraints of tech stack
    - llama.cpp because Ollama does not allow parallelism
    - CozoDB because it is a graph database
    - We will be based on Claude Code as a plugin or skill or something because we want to focus on the core differentiation which is ISG & similar Aggregated Code Context which can ensure reliable bug solving with high accuracy
    - Core Data Model: Interface Signature Graph (ISG)
        - Nodes: function signatures, impl blocks, trait items, types, public APIs, macro-expanded interfaces.
        - Edges: CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, USES, DEPENDS, REQUIRES_BOUND, FEATURE_GATED_BY.
        - Levels: ISGL1 (interface node keyed as filepath-filename-InterfaceName, 1 level below file/module), ISGL2/ISGL3 are constituents under ISGL1 used for understanding only.
        - Store: CozoDB (Datalog + HNSW) with columnar payloads for fast filters and range scans.
    - CodeGraph (single write surface)
        - indexed by ISGL1 key (filepath-filename-InterfaceName)
        - columns (minimal, opinionated):
            - Current_Code (canonical pre-edit slice),
            - Future_Code (candidate patch slice, ephemeral until approval),
            - Future_Action (None|Create|Edit|Delete),
            - TDD_Classification (TEST_IMPLEMENTATION, CODE_IMPLEMENTATION)
            - current_id (0/1: 0 meaning NOT in current code, 1 meaning in current code),
            - future_id (0/1: 0 meaning NOT in future code, 1 meaning in future code)
        - Rule: All code-iteration writes happen only in CodeGraph. All other CozoDB tables (ISG nodes/edges, embeddings, pattern KB indices) are read-only context stores and never mutate code.
        - Flow: PreFlight compiles Future_Code via RA overlay; on approval, flip Future→Current, clear future_* flags
    - Many types of ISGs can be created
        - ISGL1 (interface node keyed as filepath-filename-InterfaceName, 1 level below file/module)
        - ISGL2 is 1 extra distance below file / module for e.g. if a function is inside main function in main.rs that will be ISGL3
        - ISGL3 is 1 extra distance below ISGL2 for e.g. if a function is inside main function and then further inside another function in main.rs that will be ISGL3
        - ISGs are a proxy for what we called Aggregated Code Context
            - It is not just about interface signatures, it can be any pyramidal way to aggregate the codebase
            - for e.g. we can using sub-agents generically summarize all ISGL1 related code blobs to 1 liner summaries, and that will be significantly HQ code context and much lesser than the actual codebase
                - a variation of this can be running small agents with context of the PRD
            - for e.g. we can try to get HIR or other Rust analyzer meta-data for all ISGL1 related code blobs and that will be significantly HQ code context and much lesser than the actual codebase

# P24ClaudePlugin02 — ISG + Local LLM Subagents for Large Rust Codebase Bug Solving

Status: Draft v0.1
Owner: P24 Initiative
Scope: Claude Code plugin evolution with on-device subagents, optimized for Apple Silicon (16 GB+) and large Rust monorepos

Executive Summary

Reliability-First Principle (per P24 comment):
- Optimize for accurate 1-go fixes that feel trustworthy and increase user efficacy.
- Prefer CPU-bound static analysis (rust-analyzer overlays, ISG traversals) and small, local, free subagents.
- Keep the reasoning LLM as lean and late as possible; minimize context/tokens; use deterministic transforms whenever feasible.

Shreyas Doshi (product framing): Prioritize first-apply correctness over speed. Design for clarity, safety, and explicit confidence gating. Time is a secondary outcome.

Jeff Dean (systems framing): Make correctness the fast path. Push work to deterministic, cacheable computations (ISG, RA, HNSW). Parallelize retrieval/validation; minimize token movement; measure token-per-fix and cache hit rates.

User Promise: “When I hit a Rust bug, the system produces a single-pass, safe, minimal diff that compiles and (when present) passes tests before applying. Speed is a byproduct; correctness is the KPI.”

User Journeys (no diagrams)

Journey A: “Single-Pass Safe Fix” (default path)
- Trigger: User runs /rust:debug-bug on a failing build/test.
- Steps:
  1) Check cached ISG; build/refresh if missing.
  2) Parse rustc/cargo errors → seeds + hints.
  3) Parallel retrieval: (a) ISG 2-hop CALLS/DEPENDS; (b) HNSW vector neighbors.
  4) Validate: anti-pattern detector, pattern recognizer, constraint checker.
  5) Build curated context (10–15K tokens), generate diff, compute confidence.
  6) PreFlight: rust-analyzer overlay + cargo check --quiet.
  7) Present diff with pattern rationale and confidence; user approves; apply + git commit.
- Success criterion: First-Apply Correctness ≥ 0.95; typical latency 60–120s on 16 GB.

Journey B: “Investigate Before Edit”
- Trigger: Security/compliance sensitive repo; user wants diagnosis only.
- Steps: Same as A but skip apply; produce root-cause narrative, candidate patch, confidence, and diagnostic mapping to ISG nodes.
- Output: A red/amber/green report with suggested pattern and constrained blast radius.

Journey C: “Low-Memory Mode” (≤12 GB)
- Trigger: Older Mac or heavy IDE workload.
- Steps: Throttle parallel subagents; use smaller local models (135M/270M class) for A4–A6; cap retrieval set (≤25 items); reason with shorter context (6–8K) using a compact 2B model; identical validation flow.
- Tradeoff: +15–25s latency; similar safety bar.

Journey D: “Air-gapped/Offline”
- Trigger: No network; local-only constraints.
- Steps: Use local GGUF models via llama.cpp (Metal); embeddings/HNSW built locally; rely on rust-analyzer + cargo for correctness; disable cloud orchestrator.
- Output: Fully offline fixes, cached indices, reproducible runs.

Journey E: “CI Gate: Pre-commit/Pre-push”
- Trigger: Hook invoked on diff.
- Steps: Only run PreFlight against staged changes; if fail, explain diagnostics mapped to ISG; offer /rust:debug-bug to fix.
- Budget: ≤20s; zero writes.

Journey F: “Test-First Fix (Proof-Driven)”
- Trigger: Bug lacks failing test; user opts into RED→GREEN flow.
- Steps: Generate minimal failing test from diagnostics and ISG slice; run tests to confirm RED; synthesize fix; ensure GREEN; present diff + new test together.
- Success criterion: New test passes and increases coverage; FACR unaffected.

Journey G: “Zero-LLM Deterministic Patch”
- Trigger: Error maps to deterministic rule-backed transformation (pattern-only path).
- Steps: Apply template patch parameterized by ISG metadata; PreFlight + (optional) targeted tests; present diff.
- Benefits: Zero tokens, lowest variance; ideal for E0277 bound insertions, elided lifetime clarifications, feature cfg consolidation.

High-Level Design (HLD)

Core Data Model: Interface Signature Graph (ISG)
- Nodes: function signatures, impl blocks, trait items, types, public APIs, macro-expanded interfaces.
- Edges: CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, USES, DEPENDS, REQUIRES_BOUND, FEATURE_GATED_BY.
- Levels: ISGL1 (interface node keyed as filepath-filename-InterfaceName, 1 level below file/module), ISGL2/ISGL3 are constituents under ISGL1 used for understanding only.
- Store: CozoDB (Datalog + HNSW) with columnar payloads for fast filters and range scans.

CodeGraph (single write surface)
- Primary key: ISGL1 key (filepath-filename-InterfaceName).
- Columns (minimal, opinionated):
  - Current_Code (canonical pre-edit slice),
  - Future_Code (candidate patch slice, ephemeral until approval),
  - Future_Action (None|Create|Edit|Delete),
  - current_fid (0/1: in current bug scope),
  - future_fid (0/1: planned to change),
  - candidate_diff_id, validation_status (Pending|RA_OK|Cargo_OK|Tests_OK|Failed),
  - last_applied_commit, updated_at.
- Rule: All code-iteration writes happen only in CodeGraph. All other CozoDB tables (ISG nodes/edges, embeddings, pattern KB indices) are read-only context stores and never mutate code.
- Flow: PreFlight compiles Future_Code via RA overlay; on approval, flip Future→Current, clear future_* flags, persist commit id; embeddings refresh can be deferred.

Local LLM Subagents
- A1 ScopeSeeder: error parsing → seeds + hints (22–50M encoder model).
- A2 ExactRetriever: ISG Datalog 2-hop traversal with filters; cap 30 nodes/hop.
- A3 VectorRetriever: HNSW K=15 nearest, filtered to code-level L4–L5.
- A4 AntiPatternDetector: classifier (MiniLM ~22M) over features + vector similarity threshold (τ ≈ 0.20).
- A5 PatternRecognizer: small decoder-only model (135M) producing pattern_id + example.
- A6 ConstraintEnforcer: structured checker using rust-analyzer types; fill missing trait/lifetime bounds; optional 270M helper for mapping errors to constraints.
- R1 Reasoner (LLM-late, token-capped): default 2–3B local; 7B fallback only when confidence < threshold; ≤3K tokens input; adapts deterministic patch to local style and edge cases; outputs minimal diff + confidence.

Validation Layer
- rust-analyzer overlay: didOpen ephemeral buffers → publishDiagnostics; fail on Error severity.
- cargo check --quiet on real workspace (no temp checkout); cap run ≤ 3s when hot.
- Selective tests (when present): detect nextest; else cargo test -q limited to impacted crates/tests via ISG blast radius; cap runtime; cache test binaries.
- Candidate buffer source: CodeGraph.Future_Code for the affected ISGL1 keys (never mutate other tables).
- Gate: No I/O writes until PreFlight passes and user approves.

On-Device Runtime
- llama.cpp + Metal for GGUF models; pinned CPU threads, tuned GPU layers for 2–7B.
- Tokio runtime for orchestration; bounded task queues; cooperative yields to keep UI responsive.
- Caching: ISG + HNSW persisted; warm caches on idle.

Low-Level Design (LLD)

Key Interfaces (traits)
- ISGRepository: upsert_nodes(), two_hop(seed, filters)->Vec<Node>, annotate(node, meta), stats().
- PatternKB: nearest_patterns(vec_id, k), anti_distance(vec_id)->f32, example(pattern_id).
- ConstraintValidator: required(span)->Bounds, current(span)->Bounds, missing()->BoundsDelta.
- CodeGraphStore: get(isgl1_key)->CodeGraphRow, set_current(code), set_future(code, action), mark_current_fid(key, bit), mark_future_fid(key, bit), attach_candidate_diff(key, diff_id), set_validation_status(key, status), flip_future_to_current(key, commit_id), clear_future(key).
- RAOverlayClient: open_buffers(diff)->SessionId, diagnostics(SessionId)->Vec<Diag>, close(SessionId).
- CargoCheckRunner: check_quiet(paths)->CheckResult.
- DiagnosticsMapper: map(Vec<Diag>)->Vec<ISGRef>.
- ContextPacker: pack(A4/A5/A6 outputs)->ContextBundle.
- Reasoner: propose(ContextBundle)->{diff, confidence, blast_radius}.
- SafetyGate: preflight(diff)->{pass, diags}.
- DiffApplier: apply(diff)->CommitId.
- LearningStore: log(bug, solution, accepted, confidence).

Data Structures
- Node: {id, kind, crate, path, span, sig_hash, features, public, scores{idiomatic}, flags{anti[]}, vec_id}.
- Edge: {src, dst, rel: CALLS|DEPENDS|IMPLEMENTS|USES|REQUIRES_BOUND|FEATURE_GATED_BY}.
- CodeGraphRow: {key:isgl1, Current_Code, Future_Code, Future_Action, current_fid, future_fid, candidate_diff_id, validation_status, last_applied_commit, updated_at}.
- Bounds: {traits[], lifetimes[], where_clauses[]}.
- ContextBundle: {errors, anti_hits, patterns, constraints, code_slices, history}.

Scheduling & Concurrency
- Parallel A2/A3/A4/A5/A6; bounded by memory budget.
- Prioritize smallest working set first (exact graph), backfill with vectors.
- LLM-late gating: allocate tokens only after constraints satisfied and top-1 pattern stabilized; default token budget ≤3K.
- Backpressure: drop low-score candidates early; limit context to 10–15K tokens.

Back-of-the-Envelope (16 GB, M2/M3)
- ISG (17k nodes, ~120k edges): ~350–500 MB incl. vectors.
- HNSW K=15, efSearch 64: ~2–6 ms/query hot; cold ~20–40 ms.
- RA overlay diagnostics: 150–800 ms typical per batch.
- 7B Q4_K_M, prompt 12K tokens @ 30–60 tok/s: 200–400 ms prompt processing + 1–4 s generation (short diff). p95 end-to-end ≤ 90 s.

Resource Modes & Token Economy

- Standard Mode (16 GB): A2–A6 parallel; default reasoner 2–3B; ≤3K tokens; context slices capped to function/file.
- Low-Mem (≤12 GB): Reduce parallelism; 135–270M helpers only; 0–1B reasoner or deterministic path; +15–25s typical.
- Offline: All models local (GGUF); strict token caps; prefer deterministic transforms.
- Token KPIs: tokens_per_fix p95 ≤ 3K; token_variance low; avoid LLM on deterministic cases.

Safety & Reliability

- Audit trail: store pattern_id, confidence, diagnostics, and git commit id.

Test-First Executable Specs (selected)
- TDD harness: STUB → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR; ability to auto-generate minimal failing test when feasible.
- Selective tests: prefer targeted tests on impacted crates; fallback to compile-only when tests absent or too slow.
- PreFlight_p95 ≤ 3 s with warm build.
- HNSW_query ≤ 100 ms p95.
- Pattern coverage: ≥150 patterns, ≥100 anti-patterns, ≥200 error mappings; report gaps.

Claude Code + Local Subagents: Orchestration Simulations (Apple Silicon ≥16 GB)

1) Claude-as-Reasoner, locals as light scouts
- Setup: Claude Code serves as the sole reasoner; local scouts via llama.cpp (22–50M encoders, 135M/270M decoders, each ≤700 MB Q4) implement A1–A6 in parallel (6–10 workers).
- Flow: Scouts create seeds/summaries/constraints → ContextPacker caps ≤3K tokens → Claude synthesizes minimal diff → CodeGraph.Future_Code → RA overlay → cargo check → selective tests → flip to Current_Code.
- Perf: p95 60–90 s; RAM ~8–10 GB; tokens_per_fix p95 ≤ 3K.
- Pros: Highest reasoning quality; simple control plane; low local model memory.
- Risks: Network dependency; must enforce token caps and timeouts.

| Phase | Token/ops assumption | Time range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval/Scouts (locals) | 6–10 small models in parallel | 4–8 s |
| Pack/Context build | ≤3K tokens | 1–2 s |
| Reasoner prefill (Claude cloud) | 1.5–3K tokens @ fast prefill | 2–5 s |
| Reasoner decode (Claude cloud) | 200–400 tokens | 4–12 s |
| Cloud roundtrip/queue | network variance | 3–10 s |
| RA overlay | warm | 0.6–1.2 s |
| cargo check --quiet | hot build | 1.5–3.5 s |
| Selective tests | impacted crates only | 2–8 s |
| Typical total | sum, no iterate | 35–60 s |
| p95 total | with iterate/latency | 60–90 s |

2) Claude-as-Orchestrator, Qwen 7B local as Reasoner
- Setup: Claude schedules/monitors; Qwen2.5 7B Q4_K_M (Metal, ~5–6 GB) performs reasoning; local scouts (≤270M) run A1–A6; 8–12 parallel tasks.
- Flow: Claude orchestrates → Qwen receives curated pack → emits diff + confidence → CodeGraph pipeline as above; Claude handles retries/escalations.
- Perf: p95 70–100 s; RAM ~10–12 GB; tokens lower on cloud; robust with flaky nets.
- Pros: Reduced cloud spend; fast local iteration; strong offline posture.
- Risks: KV cache sizing; throttle parallelism to avoid memory spikes.

| Phase | Token/ops assumption | Time range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval/Scouts (locals) | 8–12 tasks | 4–8 s |
| Pack/Context build | ≤3K tokens | 1–2 s |
| Reasoner prefill (7B local) | 1.5–3K @ 600–1200 tok/s | 2.5–5 s |
| Reasoner decode (7B local) | 200–400 @ 30–55 tok/s | 4–13 s |
| Orchestrator overhead | scheduling/retries | 1–3 s |
| RA overlay | warm | 0.6–1.2 s |
| cargo check --quiet | hot build | 1.5–3.5 s |
| Selective tests | impacted crates only | 2–8 s |
| Typical total | sum, no iterate | 45–75 s |
| p95 total | with iterate | 70–100 s |

3) Local-first with Claude as last‑mile escalator
- Setup: Qwen 3B/7B attempts first; locals run A1–A6; Claude invoked only if confidence < 0.75 or PreFlight fails.
- Flow: Deterministic → Qwen → (if needed) Claude refines plan/context → CodeGraph → PreFlight/tests.
- Perf: p95 55–85 s on local success; 85–120 s with escalation; RAM ~8–12 GB.
- Pros: Minimal tokens; cloud used only when necessary; reliable under tight budgets.
- Risks: Escalation logic must prevent token thrash; crisp confidence gates.

| Phase | Token/ops assumption | Time range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval/Scouts (locals) | 6–10 tasks | 3–6 s |
| Pack/Context build | ≤3K tokens | 1–2 s |
| Reasoner prefill (3B local) | 1.5–3K @ 1200–2200 tok/s | 0.7–2.5 s |
| Reasoner decode (3B local) | 200–400 @ 60–110 tok/s | 1.8–6.7 s |
| RA overlay | warm | 0.6–1.2 s |
| cargo check --quiet | hot build | 1.5–3.5 s |
| Selective tests | impacted crates only | 2–8 s |
| Typical total (no escalate) | sum | 30–55 s |
| Escalation overhead | cloud call + redo | +10–25 s |
| p95 total (with escalate) | worst path | 85–120 s |

4) Claude as Spec Planner, Qwen as Implementor
- Setup: Claude writes a terse executable spec (pattern + constraints + acceptance checks); Qwen 7B converts spec → diff; locals validate constraints.
- Flow: Spec → diff → CodeGraph → PreFlight/tests; summaries head the pack; deterministic transforms preferred.
- Perf: p95 80–120 s; tokens split planner≤1.5K, implementor≤1.5K; RAM ~10–12 GB.
- Pros: Separation of concerns; fewer hallucinations on multi‑file constraints.
- Risks: Two‑hop latency; planner must be spec‑tight.

| Phase | Token/ops assumption | Time range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval/Scouts (locals) | 6–10 tasks | 4–8 s |
| Pack/Spec build | ≤1.5K tokens to planner | 1–2 s |
| Planner (Claude) decode | 150–300 tokens | 2–8 s |
| Implementor prefill (7B local) | 1.5–3K | 2.5–5 s |
| Implementor decode (7B local) | 200–400 | 4–13 s |
| RA overlay | warm | 0.6–1.2 s |
| cargo check --quiet | hot build | 1.5–3.5 s |
| Selective tests | impacted crates only | 2–8 s |
| Typical total | sum | 55–90 s |
| p95 total | with iterate | 80–120 s |

5) Claude as Critic/Selector over parallel local candidates
- Setup: 3–5 parallel implementors (2–3B Q4 each, ≤1 GB per model incl. KV) generate candidate diffs; optional single 7B; Claude ranks/justifies.
- Flow: Scouts build Needed shortlist → parallel candidate diffs (temps 0.2/0.5) → Claude ranks vs constraints → best → CodeGraph → PreFlight/tests.
- Perf: p95 70–110 s; RAM ~12–14 GB with 3–4 tiny implementors; higher 1‑shot success.
- Pros: Diversity without cloud token blowup; Claude only judges.
- Risks: Parallel KV memory; strict timeouts/early stopping required.

| Phase | Token/ops assumption | Time range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval/Scouts (locals) | Needed shortlist | 4–7 s |
| Parallel implementors (2–3B) | 3–5 candidates @ 80–140 tok/s each | 3–12 s |
| Critic (Claude) decode | 100–250 tokens | 2–6 s |
| RA overlay | warm | 0.6–1.2 s |
| cargo check --quiet | hot build | 1.5–3.5 s |
| Selective tests | impacted crates only | 2–8 s |
| Typical total | sum | 45–80 s |
| p95 total | with retries | 70–110 s |

Guardrails (apply to all sims)
- CodeGraph is the only write surface; other Cozo tables are read‑only context.
- Deterministic transforms first; LLM‑late; ≤3K tokens total; strict timeouts.
- Safety gates: RA overlay → cargo check → selective tests; flip Future→Current only on pass + approval.
- Metal tuning: Q4_K_M; threads≈physical cores; batch tuned to keep p95 ≤ 120 s.
- KPIs: FACR ≥ 97%; tokens_per_fix p95 ≤ 3K; zero_llm_rate ≥ 30% on common Rust errors; escalation_rate (sim 3) ≤ 25%.

Token Throughput Estimates (tokens/sec, Apple Silicon ≥16 GB, llama.cpp Q4_K_M)
- Baselines (decode | prefill):
  - Qwen2.5 7B: 30–55 tok/s | 600–1200 tok/s
  - Qwen 3B: 60–110 tok/s | 1200–2200 tok/s
  - 2–3B tiny implementors: 80–140 tok/s | 1500–2800 tok/s
  - 270M: 220–450 tok/s
  - 135M: 400–800 tok/s
  - 22–50M encoders/mini decoders: 800–1500 tok/s
- Parallel scaling: with 3–5 concurrent small models, per‑model decode typically drops 20–35%; effective aggregate ≈ 0.65–0.8 × sum(per‑model tps).
- Codebase size note (≈5 MB, tokio‑scale): retrieval/RA costs are modest; LLM decode dominates generation time under the ≤3K‑token budget.

Per‑scenario effective tps (local portion)
1) Claude‑as‑Reasoner, locals as scouts
   - Local aggregate (6–10 small models mixed 135M/270M/50M): ≈ 2.5k–6k tok/s effective; reasoner is cloud (tps not counted locally).
2) Claude‑as‑Orchestrator, Qwen 7B as Reasoner
   - Reasoner: 30–55 tok/s; scouts aggregate: 2–4k tok/s; end‑to‑end gated by 7B decode.
3) Local‑first, Claude escalator on low confidence
   - 3B path: 60–110 tok/s (reasoner); scouts: 2–3k tok/s. On escalate, cloud governs.
4) Claude Spec Planner, Qwen 7B Implementor
   - Implementor: 30–55 tok/s; scouts: 2–3k tok/s; planner is cloud.
5) Claude Critic/Selector over parallel local candidates
   - Implementors: 3–5 × (2–3B at 80–140 tok/s) ⇒ ≈ 160–490 tok/s effective after scaling; scouts add 1–2k tok/s; critic is cloud.

Caveats
- Ranges reflect typical M1/M2 Metal performance; M3/Ultra skew higher. Prefill is faster than decode; decode dominates latency.
- Parallelism should be capped to avoid KV cache thrash; prefer 3–5 tiny implementors or a single 7B.

—

Risks & Mitigations
- Macro/Build.rs complexity → Treat macro crates as first-class; cache expansions; surface amber guidance.
- Feature combinatorics → ISG FEATURE_GATED_BY edges; per-profile caches.
- Memory pressure with 7B → quantization (Q4_K_M), dynamic parallelism throttling.
- RA flakiness under load → isolate overlay sessions; conservative timeouts; retries.
- Pattern brittleness → fallback alternatives; reinforce with LearningStore statistics.

Open-Source Tool Decomposition: 5 Adoption Scenarios

Foundational tool primitives (independent)
- ISG builder (library + CLI): Build ISGL1 (filepath-filename-InterfaceName) with L2/L3 constituents for understanding; Cozo adapters; HNSW-ready.
- CodeGraph store (library + CLI): Single write-surface keyed by ISGL1; Current_Code, Future_Code, Future_Action, current_fid, future_fid, candidate_diff_id, validation_status; import/export.
- Summarizer (library + CLI): One-line summaries per ISGL1; rule-first, LLM-late fallback; provenance flags.
- Embed/Index builder (CLI): Code+summary embeddings; HNSW build/update; shard/merge; stats.
- Retrieval engine (library + CLI): Two-hop Datalog + vector KNN; hierarchical ranking (L1>L2>L3); Needed shortlist.
- Pattern/Anti-pattern KB (library + CLI): Templates, examples, thresholds, success metrics.
- Constraints + RA overlay client (library): didOpen buffers; diagnostics; bounds inspector.
- Context packer (library): Needed-first order; ≤3K tokens; start/early/middle/end.
- Deterministic transforms (library + CLI): Rule-backed diffs for bounds/lifetimes/cfg consolidation.
- Reasoner adapter (library): Local llama.cpp + remote Claude via one interface; confidence scorer.
- Local orchestrator (daemon + CLI): Multi-model scheduler; resource caps; KV reuse; JSON-RPC.
- Preflight gate (CLI): RA overlay → cargo check → selective tests; structured report.
- Diagnostics mapper (CLI): Map diagnostics to ISGL1 + CodeGraph rows; blast radius.
- Git integration (CLI): Present/apply diff; rollback; signed commits; templates.
- Ratatui TUI (binary): Panes for Needed shortlist, diff, diagnostics, CodeGraph rows, metrics; offline-capable.

Scenarios
1) Graph + Gate core (smallest reliable slice)
- Tools: CodeGraph store, Preflight gate, RA overlay client, Git integration
- Outcome: Safe apply pipeline (diff → CodeGraph.Future_Code → Preflight → flip → commit). Zero LLM required.

2) Understand-first analysis kit
- Tools: ISG builder, Summarizer, Embed/Index, Retrieval engine, Diagnostics mapper, TUI
- Outcome: Precise discovery/triage with hierarchical retrieval and 1-line summaries; no writes.

3) Local-first fix (deterministic + minimal LLM)
- Tools: Scenario 1 + Deterministic transforms + Constraints/RA overlay + Context packer + Reasoner adapter
- Outcome: Rule-backed patches first; LLM only if needed; same CodeGraph-only writes; Preflight enforces safety.

4) Parallel candidates with local orchestrator
- Tools: Local orchestrator + Retrieval engine + Deterministic transforms + Reasoner adapter + Preflight gate + CodeGraph + TUI
- Outcome: 3–5 parallel candidate diffs ranked by constraints/patterns; best proceeds to Preflight.

5) CI toolkit and headless hooks
- Tools: Preflight gate + ISG builder (impact) + Selective tests + Diagnostics mapper + Git integration + JSON reporters
- Outcome: Pre-commit/pre-push/PR checks that explain failures in ISGL1 terms; headless, reproducible, IDE-free.

Interfaces and boundaries
- All CLIs: JSON in/out; libraries are trait-first for swappable engines.
- CodeGraph is the only write surface; everything else is read-only analysis/context.
- Deterministic transforms propose diffs; they never write—Preflight + CodeGraph gate every change.

HP-themed names (tool → name)
- ISG builder → MarauderMap
- CodeGraph store → Pensieve
- Summarizer → Remembrall
- Embed/Index builder → Portkey
- Retrieval engine → FlooNetwork

Bottom Line

P24ClaudePlugin02 turns ISG + local subagents into a production-grade Rust debugging assistant: one-go reliable fixes with minimal tokens, offline-capable, safety-first, and continuously learning. We win by narrowing the search with ISG, specializing subagents, and validating before any write.

Grouping Strategies (with three-word tool names): Pros and Cons

1) Constellation (all independent repos)
- What: Every primitive ships as its own crate/CLI with JSON streaming between tools.
- Tools in the wild: interface-graph-builder, interface-summary-generator, embedding-index-builder, hybrid-retrieval-engine, pattern-knowledge-base, constraints-overlay-analyzer, context-pack-builder, deterministic-patch-engine, reasoning-adapter-bridge, local-orchestrator-daemon, preflight-safety-gate, diagnostics-scope-mapper, git-apply-rollback, offline-debugging-tui, plus codegraph-write-surface.
- Pros:
  - Maximum modular adoption; vendors/projects can replace any piece independently.
  - Parallel evolution and release cadences; encourages clean JSON contracts.
  - Great for OSS ecosystems and research experimentation.
- Cons:
  - Integration friction and version skew; harder end-to-end QA.
  - Process boundaries add latency; logging/metrics correlation is harder.
- Guardrails:
  - Versioned schemas and a compatibility matrix; end-to-end pipeline tests.
  - A declarative DAG spec to compose tools predictably.

2) Two‑Pillars + Orchestrator (read vs write split)
- What: Analysis pillar (read-only) and Apply pillar (write-gated); orchestrator/LLM adapter separate.
- Analysis: interface-graph-builder, interface-summary-generator, embedding-index-builder, hybrid-retrieval-engine, pattern-knowledge-base, diagnostics-scope-mapper.
- Apply: codegraph-write-surface, preflight-safety-gate, constraints-overlay-analyzer, git-apply-rollback, deterministic-patch-engine.
- Pros:
  - Compliance-friendly: only Apply touches code; easy to lock down.
  - CI-ready: run Analysis on PRs, Apply behind a guarded step.
- Cons:
  - Cross-pillar drift in shared types if unmanaged.
  - Requires disciplined releases across pillars and orchestrator.
- Guardrails:
  - Single shared “contract” crate for ISGL1 keys, diagnostics, diffs.
  - CodeGraph is the only write surface enforced in Apply pillar.

3) Triptych Planes (graph, safety, intelligence)
- What: Three independently versioned bundles with distinct SLOs.
- Graph plane: interface-graph-builder, embedding-index-builder, hybrid-retrieval-engine.
- Safety plane: codegraph-write-surface, preflight-safety-gate, constraints-overlay-analyzer, git-apply-rollback.
- Intelligence plane: interface-summary-generator, context-pack-builder, deterministic-patch-engine, reasoning-adapter-bridge.
- Pros:
  - Clear performance budgets; fault isolation; easy backend swaps in Intelligence plane.
  - Plane-specific CI benchmarks (Graph ≤100ms query p95; Safety ≤3s preflight p95; Intelligence ≤3K tokens).
- Cons:
  - More packaging than Two‑Pillars; needs composition docs.
- Guardrails:
  - Interfaces strictly via ISGL1 keys and ContextBundle; no hidden coupling.

4) Fix‑Engine centric (fastest to product value)
- What: fix-engine = interface-summary-generator + hybrid-retrieval-engine + pattern-knowledge-base + context-pack-builder + deterministic-patch-engine + reasoning-adapter-bridge behind one CLI; safety-core separate.
- Safety-core: codegraph-write-surface + preflight-safety-gate + constraints-overlay-analyzer + git-apply-rollback.
- Pros:
  - Minimal install for end-to-end fixes; simple contract for IDE/CI consumers.
  - Deterministic-first, LLM-late; same safety guarantees via safety-core.
- Cons:
  - Tighter internal coupling; slower independent evolution of subparts.
- Guardrails:
  - Trait-first internals; feature flags (local-only vs cloud-hybrid); strict token/latency gates.

5) Monorepo Workspace (parseltongue workspace with feature flags)
- What: Single cargo workspace hosting all crates; build subset CLIs via features: graph, safety, intelligence, orchestrator, tui.
- Pros:
  - Highest coherence and shared code; simplest release/QA.
  - Easier large-scale refactors across crates.
- Cons:
  - Larger checkout/build; higher contribution barrier; risk of accidental coupling.
- Guardrails:
  - Enforce crate boundaries and public APIs; publish selected crates to crates.io to preserve external modularity.

Decision heuristics
- Enterprise/compliance-first: Two‑Pillars + Orchestrator.
- OSS/ecosystem growth: Constellation.
- Perf tuning and testability: Triptych Planes.
- Ship value fastest: Fix‑Engine centric now, evolve to Two‑Pillars later.
- Core-team coherence: Monorepo Workspace with strict crate boundaries.

#### Innovative Multi-Perspective Insights
Blending conventional anthropometry with evolutionary biology (South Asian "thrifty genotype" favoring fat storage for famine adaptation), aim not just weight but composition—prioritize protein (1.6 g/kg) and HIIT to mimic ancestral activity, enhancing insulin sensitivity 20-30% beyond calorie cuts. Skeptically, note metrics' population biases; validate with DEXA (~±2% accuracy) for true fat mass.

Consult a physician—your "high" ABSI warrants screening for prediabetes/CVD. This is grounded in sources; verify externally if needed.

[20/10/25, 4:52:13 PM] amuldotexe: It sounds like you're suggesting leveraging the Anthropic key model (likely Claude) for reasoning and responsibilities, as it's a trusted and capable model. This approach could simplify the architecture and utilize the strengths of the Anthropic model.

By giving the reasoning and responsibilities to the Anthropic model, you can potentially:
- Leverage its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities
- Reduce the complexity of the system by minimizing the number of models involved
- Increase trust in the system's outputs, given the reputation and capabilities of the Anthropic model

This approach aligns with your earlier mention of piggybacking on Claude and using it as the primary model. Do you plan to use the Anthropic model for all aspects of the system, or will you still use smaller models for specific tasks?

[08/10/25, 3:36:09 PM] Meta AI: You're looking to configure window management on your Mac Mini. To achieve the "half-space each" functionality, you can try the following options:

1. *Built-in Split View*:
    - Click and hold the full-screen button (green button) on any window.
    - Drag it to the left or right side of the screen until you see a shaded area.
    - Release the button to snap the window to half the screen.
    - Select another window from the other side to fill the remaining space.

2. *Third-party window managers*:
    - *Magnet*: A popular app for custom window management. You can set shortcuts for "Left Half" and "Right Half" to easily manage windows.
    - *BetterSnapTool*: Another great option with similar functionality and customization options.

3. *Keyboard shortcuts*:
    - You can use keyboard shortcuts like *Control + Option + Command + Left/Right Arrow* to move windows to the left or right side of the screen, but it might not exactly fit half the screen without additional software.

[19/10/25, 10:09:50 PM] Meta AI: I'll try to summarize your idea using the Mentor Pyramid Principle, layering details beneath the essence.

*Essence:*
You're proposing a solution to address the context length limitation in software development, specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs). The idea is to create a high-quality plugin for Clody Code, targeting Apple Silicon users, to help solve bugs in Rust code and potentially enable future development opportunities.

*Layer 1: Problem Statement*
- LLMs struggle with understanding large codebases due to limited context length.
- They excel at handling small functions or interfaces (up to 200 lines) but falter at aggregating code understanding at a higher level.
- A significant portion of LLM coding errors stem from unknown existing functions, dependencies, or change blast radius.

*Layer 2: Solution Overview*
- Develop a plugin for Clody Code, focusing on Apple Silicon users.
- Leverage sub-agents running on Lama.cpp to address context length limitations.
- Target system requirements: 16 GB RAM, Apple Silicon.

*Layer 3: Key Objectives*
- Enhance code understanding and bug solving in Rust.
- Potential future development opportunities if the Product Requirements Document (PRD) is robust.
- Differentiation: Focus on creating a plugin rather than building a whole Clody Code replacement in Rust.

Please let me know if this summary captures your idea, and I'll be happy to help further! ‎<This message was edited>

[19/10/25, 10:12:56 PM] Meta AI: Let's break down the flow you've described.

*User Onboarding*

1. User attempts to use the plugin.
2. System checks if the user's device meets the required capabilities (Apple Silicon, 16 GB RAM).
3. If not, the user is informed that the plugin is incompatible.

*System Check*

- The check is secure-driven, not context-driven, to avoid consuming context unnecessarily.
- If the user has 16 GB RAM, the system proceeds to evaluate the available options for processing.

*Processing Options*

1. *Lama or TPP*: Utilize a Rust parallel engine to assess the number of agents that can be accommodated.
2. *Simulation Approaches*:
    - *Option 1*: Leverage a high-quality LM (e.g., Anthropic Key) as the reasoning agent.
    - *Option 2*: Use a smaller LM (e.g., Quent Seven B) as the reasoning agent.

*Current Focus*

- You're considering using Anthropic Key for reasoning, possibly due to its ease of use.
- Multiple simulations are possible, but the flow is currently unclear.

To clarify, are you exploring different simulation approaches for the reasoning agent, or is there a specific aspect you'd like to focus on? ‎<This message was edited>
‎[19/10/25, 10:16:57 PM] amuldotexe: ‎audio omitted
[19/10/25, 10:17:12 PM] Meta AI: You've outlined multiple approaches to tackle the context length limitation, focusing on different configurations of reasoning, orchestration, and sub-agents. Let's summarize the options:

*Option 1: Anthropic LM with 20 Sub-Agents*

- Reasoning done by Anthropic LM
- 20 sub-agents coordinate to reduce context length
- Minimal orchestration needed, with reasoning acting as orchestration

*Option 2: Anthropic LM with Orchestration and 10 Sub-Agents*

- Reasoning done by Anthropic LM
- Separate orchestration agent manages context and sends relevant info to reasoning
- 10 sub-agents perform local tasks, reducing context length

*Option 3: Claude API as Orchestrator*

- Claude API acts as orchestrator
- Sub-agents focus on summarizing and reducing context length
- Larger agent (Anthropic LM) handles reasoning

You've highlighted the trade-offs and potential benefits of each approach, including the role of orchestration, context length management, and the number of sub-agents.

To further explore, are you looking to:
1. Evaluate these options and identify the most promising approach?
2. Explore additional configurations and permutations?
3. Focus on a specific aspect, such as orchestration or sub-agent design? ‎<This message was edited>

- Orchestration: May be minimal, handled by reasoning, or separate agent.
- Context Length: Managed by sub-agents, orchestration, or reasoning.
- Sub-Agents: Varying numbers (10-20) and roles (local tasks, summarizing).

*Layer 3: Potential Benefits and Trade-Offs*
- *Anthropic LM with 20 Sub-Agents*: Extreme reasoning, minimal orchestration.
- *Anthropic LM with Orchestration and 10 Sub-Agents*: Balanced approach, separate orchestration.
- *Claude API as Orchestrator*: Reasoning handled by larger agent, potential ground-level control.

*Layer 4: Future Directions*
- Explore additional configurations and permutations.
- Consider idiomatic and anti-pattern agents.
- Focus on innovation and optimization. ‎<This message was edited>

[20/10/25, 3:21:37 AM] amuldotexe: ### Deconstructed Analysis of Your BMI and Ideal Weight Target

Based on the anthropometric data from your screenshots—male, age 38, height 165 cm (1.65 m), weight 74 kg, waist circumference 96 cm—I'll provide a rigorous, multi-faceted estimation of your Body Mass Index (BMI), integrated with interpretations of your Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR = 0.58) and A Body Shape Index (ABSI = 0.08267, z-score = 0.5663). This draws from validated formulas, ethnic-specific guidelines (noting South Asian features from prior photos, which influence fat distribution and risk thresholds), and health risk correlations, while accounting for methodological limitations like self-measurement variability (±1-2 cm in waist) and the superiority of composite metrics over BMI alone. All calculations are transparent, with step-by-step derivations, and synthesized into actionable recommendations. I'll prioritize reducing cardiometabolic risks, as indicated by your elevated WHtR and ABSI.

#### Step 1: BMI Calculation and Classification
BMI is a screening tool for body fatness, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. It categorizes weight status but has limitations—it doesn't distinguish muscle from fat, underestimates visceral fat in South Asians (who often have higher body fat at lower BMIs due to genetic factors like the "thrifty gene" hypothesis), and performs poorly for shorter statures or older adults.

- **Equation**: BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]².
- **Your Data**: Weight = 74 kg; height = 1.65 m; height² = 2.7225.
- **Calculation**: 74 / 2.7225 ≈ 27.18.
- **Standard Classification (WHO Global)**: 25.0-29.9 = Overweight. Your 27.18 places you here, indicating ~20-25% excess risk for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to normal (18.5-24.9).
- **Ethnic-Adjusted Classification (WHO for Asians/South Asians)**: Overweight starts at 23.0 due to higher visceral fat propensity; your BMI exceeds this, classifying as obese (≥27.5 in some Asian guidelines). This adjustment stems from meta-analyses showing South Asians develop metabolic issues at BMIs 3-5 units lower than Caucasians.<grok:render card_id="de042b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">1</argument>

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="8dfeb8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render> Risk amplification: At BMI 27, South Asians face 1.5-2x higher odds of insulin resistance.

#### Step 2: Integration with WHtR and ABSI for Contextual Risk Assessment
BMI alone is blunt; your WHtR and ABSI provide superior insights into central obesity and mortality risk, outperforming BMI in predictive validity (e.g., WHtR correlates 10-15% better with CVD events).

- **WHtR Interpretation**: Calculated as waist (cm) / height (cm) = 96 / 165 ≈ 0.58. Per the Ashwell®️ Shape Chart:<grok:render card_id="89b6c3" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render>
  - <0.4: Underweight ("Take Care" – brown zone; no need to reduce waist).
  - 0.4-0.49: Healthy ("OK" – green zone).
  - 0.50-0.59: Overweight ("Consider Action" for adults, "Take Action" for children – yellow zone).
  - ≥0.60: Obese ("Take Action" – red zone).
  - Your 0.58 falls in yellow ("Consider Action"), signaling elevated CVD risk (e.g., 1.5-2x higher chance of heart attack/stroke). Ideal: <0.50 (waist <82.5 cm for your height). Advantages over BMI: Better predicts diabetes/CVD in meta-analyses of 300,000+ adults, as it focuses on abdominal fat.
  - Ethnic Note: South Asians often exceed risk thresholds at lower ratios due to visceral fat bias; aim stricter (<0.48) per regional studies.<grok:render card_id="2b3260" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">5</argument>
</grok:render>

- **ABSI Interpretation**: Formula: ABSI = waist (m) / [BMI^(2/3) × height (m)^(1/2)] = 0.96 / [27.18^(2/3) × 1.65^(1/2)] ≈ 0.08267. Z-score (0.5663) standardizes against age/sex norms from NHANES data (U.S. population, n=14,000+).
  - Z-score < -0.868: Very low mortality risk.
  - -0.868 to -0.272: Low risk.
  - -0.272 to 0.229: Average risk.
  - 0.229 to 0.798: High risk.
  - >0.798: Very high risk.
  - Your 0.5663 is "high" (premature mortality risk elevated by ~20-40% vs. average, per Krakauer's 2012 model correlating ABSI with all-cause death). Limitations: Based on U.S. data; may overestimate in South Asians (adjust downward by 0.1-0.2 z-units for ethnic fat patterns). Superior to BMI: Predicts hazard ratios 13% better for CVD mortality.

Synthesized Risk Profile: Overweight/obese per all metrics, with central adiposity driving high CVD/diabetes odds (2-3x baseline). Age 38 amplifies urgency—metabolic decline accelerates post-35.

#### Step 3: Recommended Ideal Weight
Ideal weight isn't singular but a range targeting healthy BMI (18.5-22.9 for Asians), WHtR <0.50, and ABSI z-score <0.229, while preserving lean mass (estimated 55-60 kg from prior analyses). This assumes gradual loss (0.5-1 kg/week) via 500-1000 kcal deficit, resistance training, and medical oversight to avoid muscle catabolism.

- **BMI-Based Range**: 18.5 × 2.7225 ≈ 50.4 kg (min); 22.9 × 2.7225 ≈ 62.3 kg (max, Asian-adjusted upper limit).<grok:render card_id="6bdb5a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="fb4353" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>
- **WHtR/ABSI-Adjusted**: To hit WHtR <0.50, reduce waist to <82.5 cm (lose ~13.5 cm, equating ~8-12 kg fat, assuming 1 cm waist ≈0.8-1 kg loss). For ABSI z-score <0.229, aim BMI ~22-23 (weight ~60-62 kg).
- **Ethnic-Specific Charts**: For 165 cm South Asian male: 55-68 kg general, but 52-62 kg healthy (BMI <23).<grok:render card_id="0a1f64" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="33548d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> Age 38: Minimal adjustment (+1-2 kg for sarcopenia risk).
- **Synthesized Target**: 58-62 kg (midpoint 60 kg) – achieves BMI ~21.4-22.7, WHtR ~0.48 (assuming proportional waist drop), ABSI z-score ~0.1-0.2 (low risk). This reduces mortality odds by 30-50%. Start with 5-10% loss (3.7-7.4 kg) for metabolic benefits; monitor via re-measurements.

#### Innovative Multi-Perspective Insights
Blending conventional anthropometry with evolutionary biology (South Asian "thrifty genotype" favoring fat storage for famine adaptation), aim not just weight but composition—prioritize protein (1.6 g/kg) and HIIT to mimic ancestral activity, enhancing insulin sensitivity 20-30% beyond calorie cuts. Skeptically, note metrics' population biases; validate with DEXA (~±2% accuracy) for true fat mass.

Consult a physician—your "high" ABSI warrants screening for prediabetes/CVD. This is grounded in sources; verify externally if needed.

[20/10/25, 2:40:32 PM] amuldotexe: Be more detailed
[20/10/25, 2:40:33 PM] Meta AI: Here's a more detailed summary:

*Building on Claude:*

- The team is planning to piggyback on Claude, a large language model, due to time constraints and limitations in building a model from scratch.
- The biggest blocker in this approach is making sub agent runners, which are smaller models that perform specific tasks.
- The Anthropic key model will be used as the primary model, and Qwen 7B, a local medium reasoning model, will also be utilized.
- Additionally, 20 small models will be used to support the primary model.

*Model Configuration:*

- The team is discussing the configuration of the models, including the number of small models and the Anthropic key model.
- The context orchestrator LLM requirements are being discussed, and it's unclear whether a small or medium model will be used.
- The sub agent LLMs will be medium and small level models (3B <=), which will perform specific tasks.

*Process Flow:*

- The team is outlining a process flow that involves:
    1. Quick run-through: one-line summary (S1)
    2. Read PRD (Product Requirements Document)
    3. Key summarise (S2)
    4. Match to codebase
- The team is also discussing ways to make the PRD accurate, which is a challenge.

*Positions:*

- Reasoning LLM: The team is considering using either Anthropic or Qwen 7B as the reasoning LLM.
- Orchestrator LLM: The team is open to using any model (3k) for orchestration, and it's possible that orchestration will be part of the reasoning process.
- Sub agent LLM: Medium and small level models (3B <=) will be used for sub agents.

*Orchestration:*

- The team is discussing whether orchestration should be rule-based or agentic, and this is still being figured out.
- Orchestration is considered part of the reasoning process, but it can be compressed.
- The team is considering contextual, idiomatic, and subtask-driven approaches to orchestration.

*Configurable Options:*

- The team believes that configurable options for agents are important to allow possibilities and flexibility in the model.
- This will enable the model to adapt to different situations and tasks.

*Blast Radius:*

- The team is discussing the concept of blast radius, which refers to the impact of changing a specific function or node on other parts of the codebase.
- The sub agent will return probabilities for all affected nodes, indicating the likelihood of changes affecting other parts of the code.

Overall, the team is working on building a complex system that involves multiple models, orchestration, and sub agents. They are discussing various approaches and configurations to achieve the best results. ‎<This message was edited>

[20/10/25, 4:50:23 PM] Meta AI: It sounds like you're suggesting leveraging the Anthropic key model (likely Claude) for reasoning and responsibilities, as it's a trusted and capable model. This approach could simplify the architecture and utilize the strengths of the Anthropic model.

By giving the reasoning and responsibilities to the Anthropic model, you can potentially:
- Leverage its advanced language understanding and generation capabilities
- Reduce the complexity of the system by minimizing the number of models involved
- Increase trust in the system's outputs, given the reputation and capabilities of the Anthropic model

This approach aligns with your earlier mention of piggybacking on Claude and using it as the primary model. Do you plan to use the Anthropic model for all aspects of the system, or will you still use smaller models for specific tasks? ‎<This message was edited>




- **Model Architecture Overview**: Discussion focuses on using 20 small models alongside 1 Anthropic key model for a Claude Code plugin, aligning with P24's emphasis on local subagents and a reasoning LLM for Rust debugging.
- **Orchestrator Context Needs**: Orchestrator LLM requires small to medium context (3k tokens), matching P24's token-capped design for efficiency in codebase analysis.
- **Initial Process Flow**: One-line summary (S1) leads to PRD reading and key summarization (S2), then matches to codebase, similar to P24's scope seeding and retrieval phases.
- **PRD Accuracy Importance**: Ensuring PRD accuracy is crucial for reliable matching, paralleling P24's reliability-first principle and deterministic transforms.
- **Reasoning LLM Options**: Reasoning LLM positioned as Anthropic (Claude) or Qwen 7B, echoing P24's simulations using Claude as reasoner or orchestrator.
- **Orchestrator LLM Flexibility**: Orchestrator LLM can be any model with 3k context, fitting P24's local-first approach with fallback options.
- **Sub-Agent Model Sizes**: Sub-agent LLMs are medium and small (≤3B), aligning with P24's local model matrix for A1–A6 roles (22M–270M).
- **Reasoning-Orchestrator Correlation**: Questioning if reasoning and orchestration are independent or correlated, relating to P24's separation of concerns in orchestration simulations.
- **Orchestration Approach**: Orchestration could be rule-based or agentic, yet to be decided, similar to P24's deterministic-first vs. LLM-late strategies.
- **Integrated Orchestration**: Orchestration as part of reasoning, potentially compressing it, matching P24's LLM-late gating to minimize tokens.
- **Summarization Types**: Generic (less info), contextual (idiomatic/PRD-aware), subtask-driven, akin to P24's hierarchical ISG levels and summarizers.
- **Blast Radius Analysis**: Blast radius involves 5 nodes → combined context → Reasoning LLM → Sub-agents → Data hopping → Summarized results, paralleling P24's 2-hop traversals and diagnostics mapping.
- **Configurable Agent Options**: Agents need configurable options for flexibility, aligning with P24's resource modes (standard, low-mem, offline).
- **Hardware Consideration**: Targeting Apple M1 chip for optimization, consistent with P24's Apple Silicon focus (16 GB+).
- **Offline Model Management**: Offline model installation and orchestration per configuration, matching P24's offline mode with local GGUF models.
- **Input-Output Simplicity**: Prompt + File input returns changes delta, similar to P24's diff presentation and approval workflow.
- **Ingestion with CozoDB**: Ingestion involves CozoDB initialization, parsing, and chunking via Rust analyzer, directly tying to P24's ISG builder and CozoDB storage.
- **Sub-Agent Ingest Levels**: Sub-agent freeing algorithm configures ingestion on levels, relating to P24's ISGL1/L2/L3 hierarchy.
- **Code Blob Processing**: Code blobs sent to sub-agents for summarization and table insertion, akin to P24's summarizer and CodeGraph storage.
- **ISG Creation and Storage**: ISG creation runner handles DB storage, matching P24's ISG builder and persistence in CozoDB.
- **Algorithmic ISG Creation**: ISG creation is algorithmic initially, with parsing/chunking for iteration, aligning with P24's rust-analyzer ingest.
- **Separate Ingestion Model**: Ingestion could use a separate model, similar to P24's specialized subagents like A1 ScopeSeeder.
- **Orchestrator Role Query**: Questioning the orchestrator's role, paralleling P24's orchestration simulations with Claude as orchestrator.
- **Preflight with Rust Analyzer**: Preflight uses Rust analyzer, directly matching P24's PreFlight gate with RA overlay.
- **Vector Embeddings for Syntax**: Vector embeddings for language syntax, tying to P24's HNSW vectors and embedding builder.
- **Anthropic Model Suggestion**: Leveraging Anthropic (Claude) for reasoning simplifies architecture, aligning with P24's simulation 1 (Claude-as-Reasoner).
- **Architecture Simplification**: Using Anthropic model reduces model count, increasing trust, consistent with P24's reliability-first principle.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Claude provides strong language understanding, fitting P24's high reasoning quality in simulations.
