## Technical Constraints and Challenges

### Rust/WASM Architecture Constraints

**ARCH-001**: WASM Performance Limitations
- Impact: medium
- Description: WebAssembly has inherent performance limitations for certain operations
- Mitigation: Use native Rust for compute-intensive operations, Minimize WASM boundary crossings, Implement efficient serialization for data transfer, Use SharedArrayBuffer where supported


**ARCH-002**: JavaScript Interop Complexity
- Impact: high
- Description: Complex interop required between Rust/WASM and JavaScript ecosystem
- Mitigation: Design clean API boundaries, Use wasm-bindgen for type-safe bindings, Implement comprehensive error handling across boundaries, Create abstraction layers for complex interactions


**ARCH-003**: Memory Management Across Boundaries
- Impact: medium
- Description: Managing memory between Rust, WASM, and JavaScript requires careful design
- Mitigation: Use RAII patterns consistently, Implement proper cleanup in Drop traits, Avoid memory leaks at WASM boundaries, Use weak references to break cycles

### Extension Compatibility Constraints

**EXT-CONST-001**: Node.js API Emulation
- Impact: high
- Description: Many extensions rely on Node.js APIs that must be emulated in WASM
- Mitigation: Implement Node.js API compatibility layer, Use polyfills for common Node.js modules, Provide filesystem abstraction layer, Implement process and child_process emulation


**EXT-CONST-002**: Native Module Dependencies
- Impact: medium
- Description: Extensions with native dependencies cannot run directly in WASM
- Mitigation: Identify popular extensions with native deps, Provide Rust implementations of common native modules, Create extension compatibility database, Implement fallback mechanisms

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

### Functional Requirements

- 100% feature parity with original Kiro
- Seamless migration from Electron to Rust/WASM
- Extension ecosystem compatibility maintained
- Configuration and settings preserved

### Performance Requirements

- Startup time improved by 50% or more
- Memory usage reduced by 30% or more
- AI response times under 1 second
- File operations 2x faster than current

### User Experience Requirements

- Pixel-perfect UI consistency
- Identical keyboard shortcuts and workflows
- Preserved muscle memory and user habits
- No learning curve for existing users

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Extension compatibility issues
- Mitigation: Comprehensive extension testing framework
- Contingency: Extension compatibility database and workarounds


**Risk**: Performance regression
- Mitigation: Continuous performance monitoring and benchmarking
- Contingency: Performance optimization sprints


**Risk**: UI/UX behavioral differences
- Mitigation: Pixel-perfect comparison testing
- Contingency: User feedback integration and rapid iteration

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architectural Principles

- Behavioral Indistinguishability: Every user-facing behavior must be replicated exactly
- Performance Enhancement: Rust/WASM provides performance benefits transparently
- Extension Compatibility: 100% compatibility with VS Code extension ecosystem
- Configuration Migration: Seamless import of existing Kiro configurations

### Development Approach

- Test-Driven Development: Write behavioral tests before implementation
- Incremental Migration: Implement features in priority order
- Continuous Validation: Compare behavior against original Kiro
- Performance Benchmarking: Measure and optimize performance continuously

## Next Steps for Phase 2
