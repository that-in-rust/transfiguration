# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Rust command-line tool to safely unpack and analyze the Kiro202509172055-distro-linux-x64.deb file. The primary user is a **security researcher** who needs to examine package contents without executing code or risking system compromise. The tool addresses the gap left by `dpkg-deb`, which lacks security sandboxing for untrusted archives.

**MVP Goal:** Enable safe, complete extraction of a .deb file with basic security protections, then incrementally add advanced features based on user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to safely extract the contents of a .deb file to a designated directory, so that I can examine all files without risk of path traversal attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a .deb file path THEN the system SHALL extract all contents to a safe output directory
2. WHEN extraction occurs THEN the system SHALL prevent any files from being written outside the target directory
3. WHEN the .deb structure is parsed THEN the system SHALL extract debian-binary, control.tar.*, and data.tar.* components
4. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL show a summary of extracted files and any errors encountered

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want protection against malicious archives, so that I can analyze untrusted .deb files without compromising my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN paths contain ".." or absolute paths THEN the system SHALL reject them and log security warnings
2. WHEN archives are deeply nested THEN the system SHALL limit recursion to prevent infinite loops
3. WHEN large files are encountered THEN the system SHALL warn about potential resource exhaustion
4. WHEN extraction fails for individual files THEN the system SHALL continue processing other files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to unpack common compression formats found in .deb files, so that I can access all nested content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tar.gz files are encountered THEN the system SHALL decompress and extract them
2. WHEN tar.xz files are encountered THEN the system SHALL decompress and extract them  
3. WHEN uncompressed tar files are found THEN the system SHALL extract them
4. WHEN unsupported formats are found THEN the system SHALL log warnings and skip them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want clear feedback during extraction, so that I can monitor progress and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction starts THEN the system SHALL show progress information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN I specify --verbose THEN the system SHALL show detailed operation logs
4. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL provide a final summary with file counts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want protection against deeply nested archives, so that I can prevent resource exhaustion and infinite recursion attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extraction depth exceeds the default limit THEN the system SHALL stop extraction and log a warning
2. WHEN I specify --max-depth flag THEN the system SHALL use the provided depth limit instead of default
3. WHEN recursion limit is reached THEN the system SHALL continue processing other files at the current level
4. WHEN depth limit is configured THEN the system SHALL validate it is a positive integer

## Future Requirements (Post-MVP)

### Advanced Security (V2)
- Comprehensive format support (zstd, bzip2, lzma)
- Content-based cycle detection with hashing
- Advanced resource limits and monitoring

### Automation Features (V3)  
- Structured JSON output for CI/CD integration
- Machine-readable manifests with metadata
- Integration-friendly error codes and formats

### Performance Optimization (V4)
- Parallel extraction with worker pools
- Streaming I/O for memory efficiency
- High-throughput processing for large archives
