I'll help you create an intuitive Mermaid diagram to understand the Claude Code codebase structure. Let me break this down using MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) analogies to make it accessible for a 15-year-old.

## ELI15 Breakdown - Claude Code as The Avengers:

### **üé¨ The Core System (Nick Fury's Command Center)**

- **Claude Code** = The Avengers Initiative - it coordinates everything
- **Terminal CLI** = Iron Man's suit interface - where you talk to the AI
- **VS Code Extension** = War Machine's armor - same tech, different deployment

### **üõ†Ô∏è Core Technology (SHIELD Equipment)**

- **Agent SDK** = Tools to build your own AI agents (like building new superhero tech)
- **Plugin System** = Avengers roster - you can add/remove specialized agents
- **MCP Servers** = External allies (like Wakanda or Asgard) that provide extra capabilities

### **üéØ Specialized Agents (The Avengers Team)**

- **Code Architect (Tony Stark)** - Designs complex systems and blueprints
- **Code Explorer (Black Widow)** - Investigates and understands existing codebases
- **Code Reviewer (Captain America)** - Ensures quality and follows standards
- **PR Test Analyzer (Hawkeye)** - Finds testing gaps with precision
- **Security Hunter (Thor)** - Protects against security threats

### **üîß How Missions Work:**

1. **Feature Development** = "Assemble the team!" - multiple agents work together
2. **PR Review** = "Mission debrief" - specialized agents check different aspects
3. **Commit & Deploy** = "Execute mission" - automated workflows handle the heavy lifting

### **üåê External Connections:**

- **GitHub** = World Security Council - handles coordination and issues
- **Discord** = Avengers Tower - community and support
- **Documentation** = SHIELD files - all the knowledge and protocols

### **‚ö° Key Superpowers:**

- **Hooks** = Mission protocols that run automatically
- **Plugin Marketplace** = Recruiting new team members
- **Multi-agent coordination** = Avengers assemble! Different specialists work together

Think of Claude Code as your personal AI superhero team that lives in your terminal, ready to help with coding missions! Each agent has special powers, and they can work together on complex tasks just like the Avengers tackling big threats.
