Test-First Development: I should be writing tests FIRST, following the STUB → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle

# CRITICAL: FOUR-WORD NAMING CONVENTION (LLM Optimization)

**ALL function names: EXACTLY 4 words** (underscores separate)
**ALL crate names: EXACTLY 4 words** (hyphens separate)
**ALL folder names: EXACTLY 4 words** (hyphens separate)
**ALL commands: EXACTLY 4 words** (hyphens separate)

**Why**: LLMs parse by tokenizing. 4 words = optimal semantic density for understanding and recall.

**📚 COMPLETE THESIS**: See `S03-four-word-naming-thesis.md` for comprehensive research validation:
- **96% LLM recall accuracy** (vs 23% for single-word names)
- **44% semantic density** (optimal tokens/word ratio from BPE analysis)
- **4±1 cognitive chunks** (Miller's Law sweet spot - validated by fNIRS brain imaging)
- **16-20 bits semantic entropy** (Shannon optimal information encoding)
- **Research-backed**: 12+ peer-reviewed studies (2024-2025) on tokenization, cognitive load, code comprehension

**Pattern**: `verb_constraint_target_qualifier()`
- Verb: `filter`, `render`, `detect`, `save`, `create`, `process`
- Constraint: `implementation`, `box_with_title`, `visualization_output`
- Target: `entities`, `unicode`, `file`, `database`
- Qualifier: `only`, `to`, `in`, `from`, `with`

**Examples**:
```rust
✅ filter_implementation_entities_only()
✅ render_box_with_title_unicode()
✅ save_visualization_output_to_file()
✅ pt01-folder-to-cozodb-streamer

❌ filter_entities()                    // Too short (2)
❌ detect_cycles_in_dependency_graph()  // Too long (5)
```

**Make this a ritual** - check every function/folder/command name before committing.

# Product thinking for us
Think like Shreyas Doshi  - the famous product leader - his minimalism - user journeys mindset

## The Essence: Executable Specifications Drive Everything

Exectuable Specifications is the concept  - stick to it 


**Core Truth**: Traditional user stories fail LLMs because they're designed for human conversation. LLMs need executable blueprints, not ambiguous narratives.

**The Solution**: Transform all specifications into formal, testable contracts with preconditions, postconditions, and error conditions. Every claim must be validated by automated tests.

**Why This Matters**: Eliminates the #1 cause of LLM hallucination - ambiguous requirements that lead to incorrect implementations.

## The Non-Negotiables: 8 Architectural Principles

These principles are derived from the Parseltongue AIM Daemon design process and prevent the most common architectural failures in Rust systems:

### 1. Executable Specifications Over Narratives
**Contract-driven development with measurable outcomes**

### 2. Layered Rust Architecture (L1→L2→L3)
**Clear separation: Core → Std → External dependencies**

### 3. Dependency Injection for Testability
**Every component depends on traits, not concrete types**

### 4. RAII Resource Management
**All resources automatically managed with Drop implementations**

### 5. Performance Claims Must Be Test-Validated
**Every performance assertion backed by automated tests**

### 6. Structured Error Handling
**thiserror for libraries, anyhow for applications**

### 7. Complex Domain Model Support
**Handle real-world complexity, not simplified examples**

### 8. Concurrency Model Validation
**Thread safety validated with stress tests**

### 9. MVP-First Rigor (New Pattern)
**Proven architectures over theoretical abstractions**
