## Navigating the JSON Structure

The `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.json` has this structure:

```json
{
  "repository": "transfiguration",
  "description": "...",
  "total_files": 305,
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section Name",
      "path": "relative/path",
      "description": "Section description",
      "file_count": 42,
      "files": [
        {
          "filename": "example.md",
          "path": "relative/path/to/example.md",
          "description": "File description",
          "sample_lines": [
            "line 1 from file",
