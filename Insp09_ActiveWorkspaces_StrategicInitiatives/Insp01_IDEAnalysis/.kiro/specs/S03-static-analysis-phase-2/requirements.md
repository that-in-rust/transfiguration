# Requirements Document: Static Analysis Phase 2 - Deep Research & Ecosystem Analysis

## Introduction

This feature focuses on **Phase 2: Deep Research & Ecosystem Analysis** to understand the broader landscape of IDE transfiguration projects, identify inspiration sources for Kiro, and conduct comprehensive primary research on similar open source initiatives. Following Shreyas Doshi's product thinking approach, we will systematically map every interaction and architectural decision before proceeding with deeper static analysis.

**Phase 2 Goal:** Conduct comprehensive primary research to understand the ecosystem of IDE transfiguration projects, identify Kiro's inspiration sources, and map competitive technical approaches to inform our Rust/WASM implementation strategy.

**Research Philosophy:** Think like Shreyas Doshi - hash out every interaction beforehand through structured research, understand the competitive landscape deeply, and identify proven patterns before building.
