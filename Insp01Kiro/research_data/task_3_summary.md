## Strategic Recommendations for Kiro

### 1. Technical Architecture
```typescript
// Recommended Kiro architecture approach
export interface KiroArchitecture {
    core: {
        language: 'rust';
        deployment: 'native + wasm';
        performance_target: 'sub_second_startup';
    };
    
    ai_integration: {
        approach: 'hybrid_builtin_and_extensions';
        providers: ['anthropic', 'openai', 'local_models'];
        caching: 'multi_level_with_semantic_similarity';
    };
    
    extension_system: {
        compatibility: 'vscode_95_percent_plus';
        marketplace: 'open_vsx_plus_custom';
        security: 'process_isolation_with_capabilities';
    };
}
```

### 2. Business Model Strategy
```typescript
// Recommended phased business model
export interface KiroBusinessStrategy {
    phase_1: {
        model: 'open_source_foundation';
        timeline: '0-12_months';
        focus: 'community_building_and_pmf';
    };
    
    phase_2: {
        model: 'freemium_with_ai_premium';
        timeline: '12-24_months';
        pricing: {
            free: 'core_ide_plus_basic_ai';
            pro: '$20_month_unlimited_ai';
            business: '$40_user_month_team_features';
        };
    };
    
    phase_3: {
        model: 'platform_with_marketplace';
        timeline: '24_plus_months';
        expansion: 'extension_marketplace_and_enterprise_services';
    };
}
```
