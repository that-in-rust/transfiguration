Question does auto-complete work here

It seems to work

Ok the user journey in my mind 


``` text

1. User arrives at the codebase
2. Interface Signature Graph is created in RAM as ISG01
    - each node is an interface signature with a unique identifier
        - the identifier is filePath-fileName-InterfaceName where InterfaceName is defined such a way that it remains unique
    - any interface is a limited set of things but ALL of them should be at first level of distance from filename, which means interfaces which are inside other interfaces are not of relevant concern
    - the interface signature is enriched with meta-data from rust analyzer
        - might include 
    - a persistent copy is created in a relevant graph database
    - a persistent copy is created in a JSON file
3. The codebase is copied into SQLlite database
    - Table Codebase has following columns
        - id
        - filePath-fileName-InterfaceName as unique identifier
        - Current_Code
        - Future_Code (empty at initiation)
        - Future_Action (empty at initiation, but filled with whether to suit the PRD change we will edit or delete or create this new interface)
