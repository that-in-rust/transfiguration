# Kiro Behavioral Analysis Results

This directory contains the complete analysis results from the Kiro behavioral discovery pipeline.

## Directory Structure

- `config/` - Configuration analysis results (package.json, settings, commands, etc.)
- `api/` - API surface mapping results (interfaces, contribution points, compatibility)
- `ui/` - UI structure analysis results (components, styling, themes, assets)
- `behavior/` - Behavioral pattern inference results (events, state, performance)
- `reports/` - Summary reports and cross-reference documentation
- `logs/` - Analysis execution logs and debug information
- `temp/` - Temporary files and intermediate processing results

## Analysis Phases

1. **File Discovery & Validation** - Inventory and validate all extracted files
2. **Configuration Analysis** - Extract commands, settings, keybindings, menus
3. **API Surface Mapping** - Document extension APIs and contribution points
4. **UI Structure Analysis** - Analyze components, styling, and visual assets
5. **Behavioral Pattern Inference** - Infer runtime behaviors from code patterns
6. **Integration & Documentation** - Generate comprehensive behavioral specification
