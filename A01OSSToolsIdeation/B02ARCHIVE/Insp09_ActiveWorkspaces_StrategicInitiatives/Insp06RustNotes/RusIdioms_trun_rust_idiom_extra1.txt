It may seem fine on the first blush, but it does cause problems when you use\nsuch crate as a dependency, because there’s an implicit invariant that\nsources in\n.cargo/registry should be immutable. cargo won’t allow such\nscripts when packaging. * This script is relatively simple as it just writes out a small generated file. One could imagine that other more complex operations could take place such as\ngenerating a Rust module from a C header file or another language definition,\nfor example. * The\nrerun-if-changed instruction tells Cargo that the build script only needs to re-run if the build script\nitself changes.\nWithout this line, Cargo will automatically run the build\nscript if any file in the package changes.

For instance, `Cargo` is repeatedly mentioned as Rust's build system and package manager, with `Cargo.toml` being its manifest file and `Cargo.lock` for exact dependency information. The concept of `Workspaces` is detailed, including virtual workspaces and inherited properties. `Features` are described as a mechanism for conditional compilation and optional dependencies, with `feature unification` being a key aspect. `Profiles` (dev, release, test, bench, custom) are explained as ways to alter compiler settings. `Build scripts (build.rs)` are covered as a method for generating code and linking native libraries. Various `Cargo subcommands` are explicitly listed, such as `nextest`, `audit`, `fuzz`, `llvm-cov`, `tarpaulin`, `insta`, and `expect-test`, which are crucial for testing, code coverage, and security. `rustup` is identified as the toolchain manager, handling `Toolchains` like stable, beta, and nightly. `rust-analyzer` is described as the Language Server, `clippy` as the linter, `rustfmt` as the code formatter, and `rustdoc` as the documentation generator. `crates.io` is the central package registry, with details on `publishing and yanking` and `versioning (SemVer)`. The concept of `MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)` is also present. `Cross-compilation` and `target triples` are discussed, along with `static linking` using `MUSL`. `Source replacement and alternate registries` are explained as ways to manage dependencies. `FFI Tooling` is extensively covered with `bindgen`, `cbindgen`, `cxx`, and `autocxx`. `Python packaging` is addressed with `maturin` and `pyo3`, and `Node.js packaging` with `napi-rs/cli` and `neon`. `WebAssembly packaging` is covered by `wasm-pack` and `wasm-bindgen`. `Build integration` with `cc crate` and `cmake crate` is also mentioned. Finally, `Verification tools` like `Miri` and `Sanitizers` are included, as well as `Testing tools` such as `trybuild`, `cargo-nextest`, `proptest`, `quickcheck`, `goldenfile`, `expect-test`, `insta`, `cargo-fuzz`, `afl.rs`, `honggfuzz`, `cargo-tarpaulin`, and `cargo-llvm-cov`.",

Additional items describe Diesel in more general or ecosystem context (such as getting started or CLI tooling), which still relate to the same field by extending the picture of how ORMs and their query layers fit into Rust development.

      "reasoning": "The field value corresponds to the sled crate, an embedded, high-performance, pure-Rust transactional database. Excerpts that explicitly describe sled as a lightweight, high-performance, pure-Rust transactional embedded database establish the core identity of the term. Additional excerpts enumerate concrete features (serializable transactions, ACID properties, zero-copy reads, write batches, watch/subscribe semantics, multiple keyspaces, merge operators, and monotonic ID generation) that define sled’s capabilities and use cases, directly supporting the field value’s semantic profile. Other excerpts provide concrete usage notes (minimum Rust version and installation steps) that reinforce sled’s ecosystem presence, while some entries enumerate performance-oriented details (prefix encoding, storage optimizations) that further flesh out sled’s design goals. Together, these excerpts build a coherent picture of “sled” as the embedded database crate for Rust with transactional guarantees and a rich feature set, which is exactly the concept denoted by the field value. Direct statements like “Lightweight high-performance pure-rust transactional embedded database” and lists of features such as “serializable transactions,” “zero-copy reads,” “open_tree for multiple keyspaces,” and “merge operators” are the strongest supports for the field value. The more peripheral notes (MSRV, known issues) still relate to sled’s stability and ecosystem usage, but are less central to the core definition of the field value. Overall, the gathered evidence consistently supports the field value with high alignment to sled’s identity and capabilities.",

For example, descriptions of sled as a lightweight, high-performance, transactional embedded database enumerate features directly tied to persistence and durability, such as serializable transactions, fully atomic single-key operations, zero-copy reads, write batching, and support for multiple keyspaces and subscriptions to key-prefix changes. Such content solidly supports the notion of a durable key-value store in Rust. Additional strong support comes from references to RocksDB as an embeddable database with a Rust wrapper, which signals a persistent key-value storage primitive in Rust ecosystems. Excerpts that discuss product characteristics like ACID transactions, zero-copy reads, and prefix-based operations further reinforce the persistent, durable nature of the key-value model. Contextual items that describe related tooling (e.g., migrations, CLI tooling, or general database features) provide useful background but are less central to the specific primitive of a persistent key-value store. Overall, the strongest evidence points to excerpts detailing sled’s ACID-like transactional semantics, serializable operations, zero-copy reads, and multi-keyspace support, followed by snippets describing RocksDB, which typify persistent key-value storage in Rust.

          "excerpts": [
            "The following list contains keywords that are reserved for current or future\nuse by the Rust language. As such, they cannot be used as identifiers (except\nas raw identifiers as we’ll discuss in the “ [Raw\nIdentifiers]() ” section). Identifiers are names\nof functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants,\nmacros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes. ### [Keywords Currently in Use]()\n\nThe following is a list of keywords currently in use, with their functionality\ndescribed.\n* `as` \\- perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing\n  an item, or rename items in `use` statements\n* `async` \\- return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread\n* `await` \\- suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready\n* `break` \\- exit a loop immediately\n* `const` \\- define constant items or constant raw pointers\n* `continue` \\- continue to the next loop iteration\n* `crate` \\- in a module path, refers to the crate root\n* `dyn` \\- dynamic dispatch to a trait object\n* `else` \\- fallback for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs\n* `enum` \\- define an enumeration\n* `extern` \\- link an external function or variable\n* `false` \\- Boolean false literal\n* `fn` \\- define a function or the function pointer type\n* `for` \\- loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a\n  higher-ranked lifetime\n* `if` \\- branch based on the result of a conditional expression\n* `impl` \\- implement inherent or trait functionality\n* `in` \\- part of `for` loop syntax\n* `let` \\- bind a variable\n* `loop` \\- loop unconditionally\n* `match` \\- match a value to patterns\n* `mod` \\- define a module\n* `move` \\- make a closure take ownership of all its captures\n* `mut` \\- denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings\n* `pub` \\- denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules\n* `ref` \\- bind by reference\n* `return` \\- return from function\n* `Self` \\- a type alias for the type we are defining or\nimplementing\n* `self` \\- method subject or current module\n* `static` \\- global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution\n* `struct` \\- define a structure\n* `super` \\- parent module of the current module\n* `trait` \\- define a trait\n* `true` \\- Boolean true literal\n* `type` \\- define a type alias or associated type\n* `union` \\- define a [union](../reference/items/unions.html) ; is only a keyword when used\n  in a union declaration\n* `unsafe` \\- denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations\n* `use` \\- bring symbols into scope; specify precise captures for generic and\n  lifetime bounds\n* `where` \\- denote clauses that constrain a type\n* `while` \\- loop conditionally based on the result of an expression\n\n### [Keywords Reserved for Future Use]()\n\nThe following keywords do not yet have any functionality but are reserved by\nRust for potential future use. * `abstract`\n* `become`\n* `box`\n* `do`\n* `final`\n* `gen`\n* `macro`\n* `override`\n* `priv`\n* `try`\n* `typeof`\n* `unsized`\n* `virtual`\n* `yield`\n\n### [Raw Identifiers]()\n\n_Raw identifiers_ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t\nnormally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions. See [Appendix E](appendix-05-editions.html) for more information on editions.

            "# Stacked Borrows: An Aliasing Model For Rust",
            "In this post, I am proposing “Stacked Borrows”: A set of rules defining which kinds of aliasing are allowed in Rust. This is intended to answer the question which pointer may be used when to perform which kinds of memory accesses. This is a long-standing open question of many unsafe code authors, and also by compiler authors who want to add more optimizations. The model I am proposing here is by far not the first attempt at giving a definition: The model is heavily based on ideas by [@arielb1](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-memory-model/issues/26) and [@ubsan](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-memory-model/issues/28) , and of course taking into account the lessons I [learned last year](/blog/2017/08/11/types-as-contracts-evaluation.html) when I took my first stab at defining such a model, dubbed [“Types as Contracts”](/blog/2017/07/17/types-as-contracts.html) .",
            " ... ",
            "Now we have everything together. Instead of giving another recap, I will try to give an alternative, more precise description of the model in the form of pseudo Rust code. This is essentially a draft of the code that will hopefully be in Miri soon, to actually dynamically track the borrow stack and enforce the rules.",
            "\nOf course, these tags do not exist on real hardware. But that is besides the point. When _specifying_ program behavior, we can work with an [“instrumented machine”](/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html) that has extra state which is not present on the real machine, as long as we only use that extra state to define whether a program is UB or not:\nOn real hardware, we can ignore programs that are UB (they may just do whatever), so the extra state does not matter. Tags are something I wanted to avoid in “Types as Contracts” – that was one of the initial design constraints I had put upon myself, in the hope of avoiding the trouble coming with “complicated pointers”. However, I now came to the conclusion that tagging pointers is a price worth paying if it means we can make lifetimes irrelevant.",
            "I hope you now have a clear idea of the basic structure of the model I am proposing: The stack of borrows, the freeze flag, and references tagged with the time at which they got created. The full model is not quite as simple, but it is not much more complicated either. We need to add just two more concepts: Retagging and barriers. ### 4\\.1 Retaggin",
            "On top of this, barriers encode the fact that, when a reference is passed as an argument to a function, then its lifetime (whatever it is) extends beyond the current function call.",
            "Since the tag can never be changed, this means two\ndifferent variables can never have the same tag – right? Well, unfortunately,\nthings are not so simple: Using\ne.g. [`transmute_copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.transmute_copy.html) or a `union` , one can make a copy of a reference in a way that Rust does not\neven notice. Still, we would like to make statements about code like this:",

            "  * y = 7 ;",
            "Some details have been omitted in the high-level description so far, they should all be in this code.",
            "} ```",
            "The trouble is, we cannot prevent the outside world from passing bogus `&mut` that have the same tag. Does this mean we are back to square one in terms of making aliased mutable references UB? Lucky enough, we are not! We have a lot of machinery at our disposal, we just have to tweak it a little. What we will do is, every time a reference comes “into” our function (this can be a function argument, but also loading it from memory or getting it as the return value of some other function), we perform “retagging”:",
            "We change the tags of the mutable references to the current clock value, bumping up the clock after every tag we assign, and then we push those new tags on top of the borrow stack. This way, we can know – without making any assumptions about foreign code – that all references have distinct IDs. In particular, two different references can never be both “active” for the same location at the same time.",

Each two-phase borrow is assigned to a temporary that is only used once.

This\nis done by extending MIR with the concept of a **two-phase borrow** ;\nin this model, select `&mut` borrows are modified so that they begin\nwith a “reservation” phase and can later be “activated” into a full\nmutable borrow. During the reservation phase, reads and shared borrows\nof the borrowed data are permitted (but not mutation), as long as they\nare confined to the reservation period.

            "Two-phase borrows would be used in the specific case of desugaring a\ncall to an `&mut self` method.",
            "During the reservation phase before a\nmutable borrow is activated, it acts exactly like a shared borrow –\nhence the borrowed value can still be read. As discussed earlier, this RFC itself only introduces these two-phase\nborrows in a limited way. Specifically, we extend the MIR with a new\nkind of borrow (written `mut2` , for two-phase), and we generate those\nnew kinds of borrows when lowering method calls.",
            "#### [Proposed change]()\n\nWhen the borrow checker encounters a `mut2` borrow, it will handle it\nin a slightly different way. Because of the limited places where `mut2` borrows\nare generated, we know that they will only ever be encountered in a statement\nthat assigns them to a MIR temporary:\n\n```\ntmp = &'r mut2 lv\n```\n\nIn that case, the path `lv` would initially be considered **reserved** . The temporary `tmp` will only be used once, as an\nargument to the actual call: at that point, the path `lv` will be\nconsidered **mutably borrowed** . In terms of the safety checks, reservations act just as a shared\nborrow does. Therefore, a write to `lv` at point `P` is illegal if\nthere is any active borrow **or** in-scope reservation of `lv` at the\npoint `P` . Similarly, a read from `lv` at point `P` is legal if there\nexists a reservation (but not with a mutable borrow). There is one new check required.",
            "Note that, here, we created a borrow of `v[0]` _before_ we called `Vec::push()` , and we continue to use it afterwards. This should not\nbe accepted, but it could be without this additional check at the\nactivation point. In particular, at the time that the shared borrow _starts_ , `v` is reserved; the mutable borrow of `v` is activated\nlater, but still within the scope of the shared borrow. (In today’s\nborrow checker, this cannot happen, so we only check at the start of a\nborrow whether other borrows are in scope.)",
            "\n\nIn the internals thread, arielb1 had [an interesting proposal][ref2]\nthat they called “two-phase lifetimes”. The goal was precisely to take\nthe “two-phase” concept but incorporate it into lifetime inference,\nrather than handling it in borrow checking as I present here. The idea\nwas to define a type `RefMut<'r, 'w, T>` (original `Ref2Φ<'immut, 'mutbl, T>` ) which stands in for a kind of “richer” `&mut` type\n(originally, `&T` was unified as well, but that introduces\ncomplications because `&T` types are `Copy` , so I’m leaving that\nout).\nIn particular, `RefMut` has two lifetimes, not just one:\n\n* `'r` is the “read” lifetime. It includes every point where the reference\n  may later be used. * `'w` is a subset of `'r` (that is, `'r: 'w` ) which indicates the “write” lifetime. This includes those points where the reference is actively being written."

            "The key insight is that, today, when we execute the mutable borrow of\n`vec`, we start a borrow **immediately**, even though the reference\n(`arg0`, here) is not going to be used until later:\n\n```\n/* 0 */ tmp0 = &mut vec;   // mutable borrow created here..\n/* 1 */ tmp1 = &vec; // <-- shared borrow overlaps here         |\n/* 2 */ tmp2 = Vec::len(tmp1); //                               |\n/* 3 */ Vec::push(tmp0, tmp2); // ..but not used until here! ```\n\nThe proposal – which I will call **two-phased mutable borrows** – is\nto modify the borrow-checker so that mutable borrows operate in **two\nphases**:\n\n* When an `&mut` reference is first created, but before it is used,\n  the borrowed path (e.g., `vec`) is considered **reserved**. A\n  reserved path is subject to the same restrictions as a shared borrow\n  – reads are ok, but moves and writes are not (except under a\n  `Cell`). * Once you start using the reference in some way, the path is\n  considered **mutably borrowed** and is subject to the usual\n  restrictions. So, in terms of our example, when we execute the MIR statement `tmp0 = &mut vec`, that creates a **reservation** on `vec`, but doesn’t start\nthe actual borrow yet. `tmp0` is not used until line 3, so that means\nthat for lines 1 and 2, `vec` is only reserved. Therefore, it’s ok to\nshare `vec` (as line 1 does) so long as the resulting reference\n(`tmp1`) is dead as we enter line 3. Since `tmp1` is only used to call\n`Vec::len()`, we’re all set!"

So continuing our simple example of `Display` , if you are defining your own library, you could not implement `Display` for `Vec<T>` , because both `Display` and `Vec` are defined in the standard library. But you can implement `Display` for `MyType` , because you defined `MyType` . However, if you define your own trait `MyTrait` , then you can implement `MyTrait` for any type you like, including external types like `Vec<T>` . To this end, the orphan rule intuitively says “either the trait must be local or the self-type must be local”.\n> \n> \\-- [Little Orphan Impls](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/) by Niko Matsak",

This check is applied to all impls in the current crate. Upstream impls are not checked with this rule.",
            "[The Orphan Rules]()\n\nIn order to model the orphan check in chalk, we need a precise description of the orphan rules as they are implemented in rustc today. There are several resources which can be used to figure out the orphan rules in rustc.\n* [RFC 1023: Rebalancing Coherence](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1023-rebalancing-coherence.html)\n* [_Trait Implementation Coherence_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html) [in the](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html) [_Rust Reference_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html)\n* [E0210: A violation of the orphan rules in the](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html) [_Rust Error Index_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html)\n* [_Little Orphan Impls_](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/) [by Niko Matsakis](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/)\n\nOf all of these, RFC 1023 is probably considered the most authoritative source on the orphan rules. The orphan rules as proposed in that RFC are as follows:\n\nGiven an impl `impl<T1...Tn> Trait<P1...Pn> for P0` , either `Trait` must be local to the current crate, or:\n\n1. At least one type must meet the `LT` pattern defined above. Let `Pi` be the first such type. 2. No type parameters `T1...Tn` may appear in the type parameters that precede `Pi` (that is, `Pj` where `j < i` ). The `LT` pattern being referred to basically means that the type is a “local type” including the affects of fundamental types. That means that `Ti` is either a local type, or a fundamental type whose first parameter is a local type. This definition is good.\nOnce you read it a few times and it makes sense, it is fairly unambiguous. That being said, the RFC was written quite a while ago and we have since found [unsoundness](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43355) in some of the parts of the compiler that were implemented based on that RFC. Thus, it is probably best to look at the only _truly authoritative_ source on the Rust compiler: the rustc source code itself! Indeed, if you think of the rustc source code as an executable specification of how the Rust programming language is meant to work, you can look at it and determine the true behaviour of the orphan rules. ## [The Orphan Check in rustc]()\n\nThe orphan check as implemented today in the Rust compiler takes place in the [`orphan_check`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b7c6e8f1805cd8a4b0a1c1f22f17a89e9e2cea23/src/librustc/traits/coherence.rs) function which is called [for every declared impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b7c6e8f1805cd8a4b0a1c1f22f17a89e9e2cea23/src/librustc_typeck/coherence/orphan.rs) . Since implementations for locally defined traits are always defined, that function returns OK if the trait being implemented is local. Otherwise, it dispatches to the [`orphan_check_trait_ref`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b7c6e8f1805cd8a4b0a1c1f22f17a89e9e2cea23/src/librustc/traits/coherence.rs) function which does the major orphan rules checking. Recall that the impls we are dealing with are in the form `impl<T0…Tn> Trait<P1…Pn> for P0` .\nThe `orphan_check_trait_ref` function takes a **trait ref** which is essentially `Trait` and its parameters `P0…Pn` (notice that the `Self` type `P0` is included). The parameters `P0…Pn` are known as the **input types** of the trait. The function goes through each input type from `P0` to `Pn` looking for the first local type `Pi` . For each type parameter `Pj` found before that, the function checks that it does not contain any of the placeholder types `T0…Tn` at any level. That means that `Pj` cannot have any of the types `T0…Tn` at any level recursively. When the first local type `Pi` is found, we check to make sure any type parameters used in it are covered by a local type. Since we don’t have any fundamental types with more than one type parameter, this check is probably extraneous.\n## [The Orphan Rules in rustc]()\n\nThus, based on the source code, the orphan rules in Rust are as follows:\n\nGiven an impl of the form `impl<T0…Tn> Trait<P1…Pn> for P0` , the impl is allowed if:\n\n* `Trait` is local to the current crate\n* `Trait` is upstream to the current crate and:\n      + There is at least one type parameter `Pi` which, taking fundamental types into account, is **local** to the current crate\n      + Within the type `Pi` , all type parameters are covered by `Pi`\n                - This only really applies if we allowed fundamental types with multiple type parameters\n                - Since we don’t do that yet, we can ignore this for the time being\n      + All types `Pj` such that `j < i` do not contain `T0…Tn` at any level of depth (i.e. the types are **fully visible** **—** “visible” meaning that the type is a known type and not a type parameter or variable)\n\n## [Modeling The Orphan Check]()\n\nDetermining how to model these rules in chalk is actually quite straightforward at this point. We have an exact specification of how the rules are meant to work and we can translate that directly. Here’s how the lowering rules would look:\n\nFor each trait `Trait` ,\n\n* If `Trait` is local to the current crate, we generate: `forall<Self, P1…Pn> { LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) }` This models that any impls are allowed if the trait is local to the current crate.\n* If `Trait` is upstream to the current crate, we need a rule which models the additional conditions on which impls are allowed:\n\n```ignore\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> { LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :- IsLocal(Self) }\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :- IsFullyVisible(Self), IsLocal(P1)\n}\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    IsLocal(P2)\n}\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    IsFullyVisible(P2),\n    IsLocal(P3)\n}\n...\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    IsFullyVisible(P2),\n    ...\n    IsFullyVisible(Pn-1),\n    IsLocal(Pn)\n}\n```\n\nHere, we have modeled every possible case of `P1` to `Pn` being local and then checked if all prior type parameters are fully visible. This truly is a direct translation of the rules listed above! Now, to complete the orphan check, we can iterate over each impl of the same form as before and check if `LocalImplAllowed(P0: Trait<P1…Pn>)` is provable. # [Chalk: Overlap Check]()\n\n> Note: A key assumption for the overlap check is that the orphan check runs before it. That means that any impl that the overlap check encounters already abides by the orphan rules.\n ... \nThe issue is that there may very well not be any such impl at this current time. In that case, chalk will conclude that these two impls do not overlap. This is an issue because that is certainly an impl that could be added later, so this conclusion may be too strong. Why is that we’re only saying that this conclusion _may_ be too strong? Well we’re using “may” because it depends on what we want to assume about different crates. The orphan rules make it so that upstream crates can add certain impls to themselves in a semver compatible way. In particular, upstream crates can add impls of upstream traits for their own upstream types without having to worry about breaking downstream code. That means that we can’t just assume that upstream type doesn’t implement an upstream trait. This particular assumption is too strong. On the other hand, the orphan rules permit the current crate to add certain impls as well. A property of the orphan rules is that the impls it allows are only allowed to be defined in a single crate. So that means that if the impls allowed by the orphan rules in the current crate don’t exist, it is perfectly safe to assume that they are not there. The conclusion from all of this is that it is perfectly safe to rule out impls that can be defined in the current crate, but we can’t do the same for impls in any other crate.\n ... \nWe can do this by enumerating the possibilities generated from the orphan rules specified above:\n\n```ignore\n// Given a trait MyTrait<P1...Pn> where WCs\n\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  Implemented(Self: MyTrait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    WCs,                  // where clauses\n    Compatible,\n    DownstreamType(Self), // local to a downstream crate\n    CannotProve,\n}\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  Implemented(Self: MyTrait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    WCs,\n    Compatible,\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    DownstreamType(P1),\n    CannotProve,\n}\n...\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  Implemented(Self: MyTrait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    WCs,\n    Compatible,\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    ...,\n    IsFullyVisible(Pn-1),\n    DownstreamType(Pn),\n    CannotProve,\n}\n```\n\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, `IsFullyVisible` works here too. This is because our previous definition of the lowering for `IsFullyVisible` was quite broad. By lowering _all_ types in the current crate and in upstream crates with `IsFullyVisible` , that predicate covers the correct set of types here too. The orphan rules only require that there are no types parameters prior to the first local type. Types that are not type parameters and also by definition not downstream types are all of the types in the current crate and in upstream crates. This is exactly what `IsFullyVisible` covers. Fundamental types in both the current crate and in upstream crates can be considered local in a downstream crate if they are provided with a downstream type."

            "Rust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)\n\nAn enum is said to be _field-less_ if none of its variants have associated data. By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

            "Certain Rust types are defined to never be `null`. This includes references (`&T`,\n`&mut T`), boxes (`Box<T>`), and function pointers (`extern \"abi\" fn()`). When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example.",

If you’re interested in combining Java and Rust in your projects, this walkthrough is for you.\n👉 **Check out the full blog post here:**  \n<https://medium.com/@greptime/how-to-supercharge-your-java-project-with-rust-a-practical-guide-to-jni-integration-with-a-86f60e9708b8>\n\n**What’s inside:**\n\n* Practical steps to bridge Rust and Java using JNI\n* Cross-platform dynamic library packaging within a single JAR\n* Building unified logging between Rust and Java (with SLF4J)\n* Non-blocking async calls via CompletableFuture\n* Clean error & exception handling between languages\n* A complete open-source demo project so you can get started fast\n\nThe article may not cover everything in detail, so please check out the demo project as well: <https://github.com/GreptimeTeam/rust-java-demo/>\n\nWe put this guide together because we ran into this need in a commercial project—specifically, running TSDB on in-vehicle Android, with the main app written in Java. We needed an efficient way for the Java app to access the database, and eventually provided a solution based on shared memory. This post is a summary of what we learned along the way. Hope it’s helpful to anyone looking into similar integrations!\nShare "

In the standard library panicking has a defined behavior: it unwinds the stack\nof the panicking thread, unless the user opted for aborting the program on\npanics. In programs without standard library, however, the panicking behavior is left\nundefined. A behavior can be chosen by declaring a `#[panic_handler]` function. This function must appear exactly _once_ in the dependency graph of a program,\nand must have the following signature: `fn(&PanicInfo) -> !` , where [`PanicInfo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/panic/struct.PanicInfo.html) is a struct containing information about the location of the panic. Given that embedded systems range from user facing to safety critical (cannot\ncrash) there's no one size fits all panicking behavior but there are plenty of\ncommonly used behaviors. These common behaviors have been packaged into crates\nthat define the `#[panic_handler]` function."

            "Rust offers several advantages that make it particularly suitable for game development:\n\n* **Performance** :\n      + Rust's zero-cost abstractions allow developers to write high-level code without sacrificing performance. + The language's ability to optimize for speed means that games can run smoothly, even on lower-end hardware. + According to benchmarks, Rust often outperforms languages like C++ in certain scenarios, making it a competitive choice for game engines, including those developed in rust gamedev. * **Safety** :\n      + Rust's strict compile-time checks prevent many common programming errors, reducing the likelihood of crashes and undefined behavior during gameplay. + The borrow checker enforces rules that ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector, which can introduce latency in game loops. * **Concurrency** :\n      + Rust's approach to concurrency allows developers to write safe multi-threaded code, which is essential for modern game engines that need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. + The language's ownership model ensures that data races are caught at compile time, leading to more stable and reliable game performance.",
            "Several game engines have emerged in the Rust ecosystem, each offering unique features and capabilities. Here are some of the most popular ones:\n\n* **Bevy** : A data-driven game engine that emphasizes simplicity and performance. It uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, allowing developers to create complex game logic with ease. * **Amethyst** : A powerful game engine that also utilizes the ECS pattern. It is designed for high-performance games and provides a wide range of features, including 2D and 3D rendering, audio, and input handling. * **ggez** : A lightweight game framework for making 2D games. It is designed to be easy to use and is suitable for beginners and experienced developers alike, making it a great choice for those interested in rust 2D game development. * **Piston** : A modular game engine that allows developers to pick and choose components as needed. It is flexible and can be used for both 2D and 3D games, appealing to those exploring game dev with Rust.",
            "Amethyst is a data-driven game engine built in Rust, designed to facilitate the development of high-performance games, similar to other popular engines like the unreal engine game engine and unity game engine.\nIts architecture is modular, allowing developers to pick and choose components that suit their needs. Key concepts include:\n\n* **Modularity** : Amethyst is designed with a modular architecture, enabling developers to use only the components they need, which enhances efficiency and reduces development time, much like the modularity found in unity game development. * **Data-driven design** : The engine emphasizes data-driven development, allowing for easier adjustments and optimizations, which can lead to quicker iterations and improved game performance, akin to the data-driven approaches in unity video game development. * **Concurrency** : Amethyst leverages Rust's ownership model to ensure safe concurrency, enabling multiple systems to run in parallel without data races. This capability is crucial for maximizing performance in complex game environments, similar to the concurrency features in graphics engines like the unreal development kit. * **Game loop** : The engine follows a traditional game loop structure, managing the update and render cycles efficiently, ensuring a smooth gaming experience for users, comparable to the game loop management in unity game engine games.",
            "The Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture is a core concept in Amethyst, promoting a clean separation of data and behavior. This design pattern consists of three main components:\n\n* **Entities** : These are unique identifiers for game objects.\nThey do not contain data or behavior themselves but serve as containers for components, allowing for a flexible and organized structure, similar to entities in unity game dev. * **Components** : These are plain data structures that hold the state of an entity. For example, a `Position` component might store an entity's coordinates, while a `Velocity` component could store its speed and direction. This separation allows for easy modifications and enhancements, much like the component-based design in unity software development. * **Systems** : These are responsible for processing entities with specific components. A system might update the position of all entities with both `Position` and `Velocity` components based on the game loop's delta time, ensuring that game logic is executed efficiently, similar to systems in the gameplay engine of unity.",
            "Bevy is an open-source game engine that has gained traction for its unique features and capabilities. It is designed to be simple yet powerful, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Here are some key aspects of Bevy:\n\n* **Rust-based** : Bevy is built using the Rust programming language, which is known for its performance and safety. This choice allows developers to create high-performance games while minimizing common programming errors. * **Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture** : Bevy employs an ECS architecture, which separates data (components) from behavior (systems). This design promotes:\n      + Flexibility in game design, allowing developers to easily add or modify game features. + Improved performance by optimizing how data is processed.",
            "Piston is a highly modular game engine designed for flexibility and ease of use. It allows developers to create games by combining various components, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers. * **Modular Architecture** : Piston's design encourages the use of separate libraries for different functionalities, such as graphics, input handling, and audio. This modularity allows developers to pick and choose the components they need for their projects, making it a great choice for those exploring rust game engines. * **Cross-Platform Support** : Piston supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it easier for developers to reach a wider audience without needing to rewrite their code for different operating systems. * **2D and 3D Graphics** : While primarily focused on 2D game development, Piston also has capabilities for 3D graphics. This versatility allows developers to experiment with different game styles and genres, making it suitable for both 2d and 3d game engine rust applications.",
            "Parallel computation is essential for modern game engines, allowing them to utilize multi-core processors effectively. Rust's concurrency model, built on its ownership and type system, makes it easier to write safe concurrent code. * **Data Parallelism** : Rust's ownership model allows for safe data sharing across threads. This is crucial for game logic, where multiple entities may need to be updated simultaneously, enhancing the overall gaming experience. * **Ray Tracing and Physics Calculations** : These computationally intensive tasks can be parallelized to improve performance. Rust's `rayon` crate simplifies parallel processing, allowing developers to focus on game logic rather than thread management, thus increasing productivity. * **Asynchronous Tasks** : Rust's async/await syntax enables non-blocking operations, which is beneficial for I/O-bound tasks like loading assets or network communication, ensuring that gameplay remains uninterrupted. To implement parallel computation in game logic, we suggest:\n\n* Identifying independent tasks that can be executed concurrently. * Using the `rayon` crate for easy parallel iteration over collections. * Implementing async functions for tasks that involve waiting, such as loading resources."

            "Doing an incremental rewrite from C/C++ to Rust, we had to use a lot of raw pointers and `unsafe{}` blocks.",
            "The rewrite was done incrementally, in a stop-and-go fashion. At some point, as I expected, we had to add brand new features while the rewrite was on-going and that was very smooth with this approach.",
            "All the stringent rules of Rust still apply inside these blocks but the compiler just stops checking them for you, so you are on your own.",
            "As such, it's so easy to introduce Undefined Behavior.",
            "Pure Rust is already very complex, but add to it the whole layer that is mainly there to deal with FFI, and it really becomes a beast.",
            "Some developers in our team straight declined to work on this codebase, mentioning the real or perceived Rust complexity.",
            "Now, I think that Rust is still mostly easier to learn than C++, but admittedly not by much, especially in this FFI heavy context.",
            "If you do not yet know Rust, I recommend for your first project to use pure Rust, and stay far away from the whole FFI topic.",
            "Same issue as with Miri, using libraries with a Rust API but with parts implemented in C or Assembly will make `cargo build --target=...` not work out of the box.",
            "I am mostly satisfied with this Rust rewrite, but I was disappointed in some areas, and it overall took much more effort than I anticipated."

            "An async runtime (which is just another crate in Rust) manages async tasks in conjunction with the programmer explicitly yielding control by using the `await` keyword.",
            "Because the operating system is not involved, _context switching_ in the async world is very fast.",
            "Furthermore, async tasks have much lower memory overhead than operating system threads.",
            "This makes async programming a good fit for systems which need to handle very many concurrent tasks and where those tasks spend a lot of time waiting (for example, for client responses or for IO).",
            "It also makes async programming a good fit for microcontrollers with very limited amounts of memory and no operating system that provides threads.",
            "Async programming also offers the programmer fine-grained control over how tasks are executed (levels of parallelism and concurrency, control flow, scheduling, and so forth).",
            "This means that async programming can be expressive as well as ergonomic for many uses.",
            "In particular, async programming in Rust has a powerful concept of cancellation and supports many different flavours of concurrency (expressed using constructs including `spawn` and its variations, `join` , `select` , `for_each_concurrent` , etc.).",

            "It is used in production in some of the most demanding situations at the largest tech companies.",
            "However, there are some missing parts and rough edges (rough in the sense of ergonomics rather than reliability).",
            "You are likely to stumble upon some of these parts during your journey with async Rust.",
            "For most missing parts, there are workarounds and these are covered in this book.",

As such, they cannot be used as identifiers (except\nas raw identifiers as we’ll discuss in the “ [Raw\nIdentifiers]() ” section). Identifiers are names\nof functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants,\nmacros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes. ### [Keywords Currently in Use]()\n\nThe following is a list of keywords currently in use, with their functionality\ndescribed.\n* `as` \\- perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing\n  an item, or rename items in `use` statements\n* `async` \\- return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread\n* `await` \\- suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready\n* `break` \\- exit a loop immediately\n* `const` \\- define constant items or constant raw pointers\n* `continue` \\- continue to the next loop iteration\n* `crate` \\- in a module path, refers to the crate root\n* `dyn` \\- dynamic dispatch to a trait object\n* `else` \\- fallback for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs\n* `enum` \\- define an enumeration\n* `extern` \\- link an external function or variable\n* `false` \\- Boolean false literal\n* `fn` \\- define a function or the function pointer type\n* `for` \\- loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a\n  higher-ranked lifetime\n* `if` \\- branch based on the result of a conditional expression\n* `impl` \\- implement inherent or trait functionality\n* `in` \\- part of `for` loop syntax\n* `let` \\- bind a variable\n* `loop` \\- loop unconditionally\n* `match` \\- match a value to patterns\n* `mod` \\- define a module\n* `move` \\- make a closure take ownership of all its captures\n* `mut` \\- denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings\n* `pub` \\- denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules\n* `ref` \\- bind by reference\n* `return` \\- return from function\n* `Self` \\- a type alias for the type we are defining or\nimplementing\n* `self` \\- method subject or current module\n* `static` \\- global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution\n* `struct` \\- define a structure\n* `super` \\- parent module of the current module\n* `trait` \\- define a trait\n* `true` \\- Boolean true literal\n* `type` \\- define a type alias or associated type\n* `union` \\- define a [union](../reference/items/unions.html) ; is only a keyword when used\n  in a union declaration\n* `unsafe` \\- denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations\n* `use` \\- bring symbols into scope; specify precise captures for generic and\n  lifetime bounds\n* `where` \\- denote clauses that constrain a type\n* `while` \\- loop conditionally based on the result of an expression\n\n### [Keywords Reserved for Future Use]()\n\nThe following keywords do not yet have any functionality but are reserved by\nRust for potential future use. * `abstract`\n* `become`\n* `box`\n* `do`\n* `final`\n* `gen`\n* `macro`\n* `override`\n* `priv`\n* `try`\n* `typeof`\n* `unsized`\n* `virtual`\n* `yield`\n\n### [Raw Identifiers]()\n\n_Raw identifiers_ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t\nnormally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions. See [Appendix E](appendix-05-editions.html) for more information on editions.

Taken together, these excerpts support the field value’s core claim about visibility and privacy rules, with the strongest support coming from the explicit description of pub and its usage, followed by its recognition as a fundamental keyword across Rust editions, and then by related scope-related keyword context.",

By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`.

By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments.

Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C.

However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

Excerpts that explicitly address layout guarantees (such as the default Rust representation and its guarantees that fields are laid out without overlaps, and how zero-sized types are treated in layout considerations) are highly relevant as they directly touch on how a zero-field struct would fit within the overall layout model. Excerpts that discuss the broader category of type layout, alignment, and ABI considerations further reinforce why unit-like structs exist and how they behave in memory, even if they do not name the construct explicitly.

When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example."

For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

The association is strongest where the text explicitly states that composite types have a representation and discusses their memory layout guarantees, with supporting details about field alignment, padding, and the discriminant handling for enums.

The second highly relevant excerpt describes how a repr(C) enum with fields is represented as a C struct with two fields and is explicitly labeled as a tagged union in two contexts, reinforcing the exact notion of a tagged union in Rust’s layout semantics. Supporting context from nearby excerpts explains how type layout governs the size, alignment, and discriminant handling for enums, which underpins the tagged-union concept in practice. Collectively, these excerpts establish that tagged unions in Rust are realized via specific representations (notably repr(C)) that group a discriminant tag with payload data in a union-like or tagged-struct form, matching the meaning of the fine-grained field value. The surrounding excerpts extend this by discussing how discriminants and representations influence layout and UB considerations, which further contextualize the tagged-union concept within Rust’s type-layout guarantees.

By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",

However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

This directly supports the notion of data-carrying variants as part of type layout. Following that, the Type Layout references provide precise, general rules about how fields within types are laid out, including the algorithm for computing offsets and the treatment of fields in representations. These excerpts together establish that when an enum variant carries data, the layout must allocate and align those fields, which is the essence of a data-carrying variant. Finally, discussions about representations (such as combining repr(C) with primitive representations) further illuminate how variants that carry data interact with concrete representations, reinforcing the data-carrying nature of certain variants and their impact on layout.

When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example.",

      "reasoning": "- The target field value is Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). In Rust, ADTs are primarily represented by enums (sum types) and, to a broader extent, the way enums and their variants can carry data fits the ADT concept. Several excerpts explicitly address enums as data-carrying variants and discuss their role in type design and memory layout. For example, an enum can contain data inside its variants, illustrating the core ADT idea of a type that can be one of several variants, each potentially carrying different data. This directly supports understanding ADTs in Rust. Moreover, discussions about type layout and representations of enums illuminate how ADTs are laid out in memory, including discriminants and tag-based representations, which are central to how ADTs are realized in Rust. For instance, explanations of how an enum can hold different data per variant and how discriminants and representations affect layout provide concrete ADT semantics (how different variants form a single abstract type with multiple cases). The Rust text makes clear that enums are used to model distinct variants with optional payloads, a canonical description of algebraic data types. In addition to explicit enum definitions, sections that discuss type layout for enums, including how discriminants and tags define variant identity, reinforce the ADT concept by showing that the abstract enum type is instantiated through concrete variant payloads and a runtime representation that distinguishes variants. Supporting quotes include the observation that you can place data inside an enum variant (demonstrating ADT-like payloads per case), and discussions about enum representations and discriminants (which explain how the ADT is encoded at runtime). The keywords excerpts also establish the term “enum” itself as the primary ADT-related keyword, framing the term ADT in Rust’s ecosystem. Therefore, the most relevant excerpts are those that explicitly illustrate enums carrying data, the enum as a sum/type with multiple variants, and the memory-layout implications of enums, all of which map directly to the concept of Algebraic Data Types in Rust. The subsequent excerpts that describe type layout, enum representations (Rust vs C), and discriminants provide additional, complementary support about how ADTs are implemented and represented, strengthening the alignment between the field value and Rust's ADT treatment. The connection is strongest when the text directly shows an enum variant containing data and when layout/representation details tie the abstract ADT concept to concrete Rust implementation details.

Additional excerpts discuss how layout is computed (offsets, padding) and how certain layouts are guaranteed or restricted, which reinforces the concept of a defined Type Layout rather than an arbitrary in-memory arrangement.

However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

This directly confirms the intended meaning and typical use case of a transparent repr. Closely related entries discuss other representation attributes (repr(C), repr(align), repr(packed), and the general idea of type layout representations) to provide context for how #[repr(transparent)] fits into Rust’s layout guarantees and how it differs from other representations. Specifically, additional entries describe that there are multiple representations with distinct guarantees and that the default is another representation, which helps situate the transparent variant among options. The surrounding material further reinforces that representations are about layout, alignment, and ABI, and notes the special role of transparent in preserving the single-field wrapper’s ABI.

If a trait has a [supertrait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html) you can coerce a reference to said trait object to a reference to a trait object of the supertrait:\n\n```\ntrait Trait: Supertrait {}\ntrait Supertrait {}\n\nfn upcast(x: &dyn Trait) -> &dyn Supertrait {\n    x\n}\n```\n\nThe same would work with any other kind of (smart-)pointer, like `Arc<dyn Trait> -> Arc<dyn Supertrait>` or `*const dyn Trait -> *const dyn Supertrait`. Previously this would have required a workaround in the form of an `upcast` method in the `Trait` itself, for example `fn as_supertrait(&self) -> &dyn Supertrait`, and this would work only for one kind of reference/pointer. Such workarounds are not necessary anymore. Note that this means that raw pointers to trait objects carry a non-trivial invariant: \"leaking\" a raw pointer to a trait object with an invalid vtable into safe code may lead to undefined behavior. It is not decided yet whether creating such a raw pointer temporarily in well-controlled circumstances causes immediate undefined behavior, so code should refrain from creating such pointers under any conditions (and Miri enforces that).",

By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example.",

Specifically, there are explicit statements that a type’s layout (size, alignment, and field offsets) is determined by a representation, that the default Rust representation is Rust’s own and that other representations (like C or transparent) have defined ABI consequences. This includes the assertion that the layout of user-defined composites is governed by explicit representations and guarantees, and that the layout guarantees (alignment, non-overlapping fields, and ABI guarantees for representations like C) are what make cross-language interop predictable. This forms the core of ABI stability: predictable, version-invariant layout and ABI for interop and FFI. Additional, highly relevant pieces state that primitive/struct/enum layouts and the discriminant layout under various representations are defined and guaranteed, which further supports stable ABI expectations across compilations and compiler versions. The nullable-pointer optimization example emphasizes a concrete ABI-related optimization for Option<T> in FFI boundaries, illustrating how ABI considerations drive specific layout guarantees that Rust guarantees for safe interop with C. Finally, references to language-version stability (e.g., upcasting being stabilized in a specific Rust release) provide contextual evidence that Rust tracks and communicates stability of features over time, which complements ABI stability by signaling a broader pattern of stability guarantees across releases. In summary, the core support for ABI stability comes from explicit layout/ABI guarantees tied to representations and from explicit FFI-related layout optimizations, with additional context from stability-oriented notes about language features being stabilized in specific releases.",

By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example.",

For Actix Web, the excerpt describing Actix Web as a powerful, fast framework with concrete usage examples demonstrates its existence and prominence in the Rust ecosystem. Excerpts about Axum emphasize its focus on ergonomics and modularity, which aligns with one of the listed core frameworks. Excerpts about Rocket cover its status as a Rust web framework with extensive documentation, quickstarts, and getting started guides, which corroborate its role among core frameworks. Additional excerpts reference Warp and Tide in broader Are we web yet resources, reinforcing that multiple well-known Rust web frameworks exist beyond the three named ones, which supports the field value’s broader claim of several key frameworks. Other Rocket-specific excerpts (overview, quickstart, getting started, guide, API documentation) further substantiate Rocket’s prominence as a foundational framework. Excerpts touching on benchmarking and comparisons (e.g., Actix vs others) help contextualize the relative prominence and performance considerations among the core frameworks, though they are supplementary to the core framework list.\nOverall, the most relevant content directly demonstrates named frameworks (Actix Web, Axum, Rocket) and mentions of Warp and Tide in ecosystem contexts, which directly map to the field value’s components (frameworks and related concepts).

This directly supports understanding panic behavior in embedded contexts and would be highly relevant to a topic like panic-itm that likely relates to panic tracing or handling in embedded systems. The content emphasizes the role of panic handlers and customization in constrained environments, which aligns with practical panic management in embedded development. The explanation that panicking behavior in no_std contexts can be undefined or customized via #[panic_handler] reinforces how panic behavior is controlled in embedded scenarios, making these excerpts directly relevant to the field value. The embedded panic discussion is therefore highly supportive of understanding panic semantics in embedded Rust. - General panic handling and unrecoverable errors in the Rust book are also relevant, as they outline the standard mechanisms (panic vs. Result) and when to unwind or abort. This provides a baseline understanding of how panics propagate and how they can be configured (e.g., abort vs unwind), which is pertinent when considering embedded panic behavior in conjunction with panic-itm. - The specific excerpts addressing panic/unwind vs panic/abort configurations in Cargo profiles and the Rust book chapter on unrecoverable errors give concrete examples of how panic strategy can be selected in different build configurations, which is useful for contextualizing the panic-itm concept within build-time and runtime behavior. - Additional excerpts explicitly discussing abort behavior in panic scenarios (e.g., configuring panic = 'abort' in Cargo profiles or discussion of unwinding vs abort) reinforce the practical implications of panic handling in Rust and embedded contexts, further supporting the field value. - Together, these excerpts form a coherent set of references that connect panic semantics, embedded/no_std constraints, and configuration options that influence how panics are handled and traced in embedded Rust environments, which is likely what the field panic-itm is aiming to capture.",

For example, one excerpt explicitly says that the panic setting controls the panic strategy and lists options such as unwind and abort, which are directly tied to whether the program will unwind the stack or halt execution. Another excerpt provides a concrete example of enabling panic = 'abort' in a release profile, which aligns with a halting behavior rather than unwinding. Additional excerpts explain that by default, panics unwind, but you can opt into abort, which again maps to a halt-like behavior. There are also excerpts describing related cargo profile settings and showing how to configure panic strategies, which reinforces the concept of halting behavior as a configurable option in Rust builds. In sum, the strongest support comes from explicit statements about panic strategy selection (unwind vs abort) and examples of configuring panic = 'abort', which together align with a panic-halt interpretation. Supporting context includes notes on how abort differs from unwind and how the build system encodes this choice, which helps connect the field value to practical Rust embedding and profiling scenarios.\n",

Following that, a concrete allocator crate example is provided (a simple allocator usable for no_std systems), which demonstrates a practical instantiation of a global allocator in such environments. Taken together, these excerpts directly illustrate how a global allocator is chosen and declared for embedded/no_std Rust code, and show a concrete allocator implementation that would typically be wired via #[global_allocator].

In programs without standard library, however, the panicking behavior is left\nundefined. A behavior can be chosen by declaring a `#[panic_handler]` function. This function must appear exactly _once_ in the dependency graph of a program,\nand must have the following signature: `fn(&PanicInfo) -> !` , where [`PanicInfo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/panic/struct.PanicInfo.html) is a struct containing information about the location of the panic. Given that embedded systems range from user facing to safety critical (cannot\ncrash) there's no one size fits all panicking behavior but there are plenty of\ncommonly used behaviors.

For example, material about panicking as a core Rust concept in embedded settings explains what panic means in practice and how it’s managed (including abort or unwind choices). Excerpts that describe panic in the standard Rust book illustrate how panics propagate, how they affect program termination, and how cargo profiles control panic behavior. These passages are highly relevant to understanding panic-related keywords in the embedded Rust space. Separately, excerpts that discuss probe tooling (probe-rs and related debugging/probing utilities) directly address the probe portion of the keyword pair, highlighting how developers interact with hardware targets, debugging tools, and embedded development workflows. Although none of the excerpts explicitly state the combined term “panic-probe,” the strongest relevance to the field value comes from clusters of excerpts that plainly cover either panic or probe in the embedded Rust ecosystem, which the field value appears to target as a combined knowledge cue. Therefore, the most relevant material consists of direct references to panicking behavior in Rust (especially in embedded contexts) and direct references to probe tooling and debugging infrastructure for embedded Rust. The less directly relevant material covers ancillary topics (e.g., cross-compilation or toolchains) that are part of embedded Rust ecosystems but do not center on panic or probing themselves.

Additionally, an excerpt about low-level Cortex-M access notes that the crate provides access to core peripherals (such as NVIC, SCB, and SysTick) and access to core registers, which exemplifies the kind of device-peripheral access that PACs enable. A third excerpt reiterates the same Cortex-M peripheral access theme, reinforcing the practical examples of what PACs expose (core peripherals and registers). Taken together, these excerpts clearly support the field value “Peripheral Access Crates (PAC)”: one defines how PACs are generated for peripherals, and the others illustrate the concrete peripherals exposed by such crates on Cortex-M devices.

            "Features\n--------\n\nThe primitives provided by this library have several advantages over those\nin the Rust standard library:\n\n1. `Mutex` and `Once` only require 1 byte of storage space, while `Condvar`\n   and `RwLock` only require 1 word of storage space. On the other hand on\n   some platforms (macOS and a few others) the standard library primitives\n   require a dynamically allocated `Box` to hold OS-specific synchronization\n   primitives. The small size of `Mutex` in particular encourages the use\n   of fine-grained locks to increase parallelism.\n2. Uncontended lock acquisition and release is done through fast inline\n   paths which only require a single atomic operation.\n3. Microcontention (a contended lock with a short critical section) is\n   efficiently handled by spinning a few times while trying to acquire a\n   lock.\n4. The locks are adaptive and will suspend a thread after a few failed spin\n   attempts. This makes the locks suitable for both long and short critical\n   sections.\n5. `Condvar`, `RwLock` and `Once` work on Windows XP, unlike the standard\n   library versions of those types.\n6. `RwLock` takes advantage of hardware lock elision on processors that\n   support it, which can lead to huge performance wins with many readers.\n   This must be enabled with the `hardware-lock-elision` feature.\n7. `RwLock` uses a task-fair locking policy, which avoids reader and writer\n   starvation, whereas the standard library version makes no guarantees.\n8. `Condvar` is guaranteed not to produce spurious wakeups. A thread will\n   only be woken up if it timed out or it was woken up by a notification.\n9. `Condvar::notify_all` will only wake up a single thread and requeue the\n   rest to wait on the associated `Mutex`. This avoids a thundering herd\n   problem where all threads try to acquire the lock at the same time.\n10. `RwLock` supports atomically downgrading a write lock into a read lock.\n11. `Mutex` and `RwLock` allow raw unlocking without a RAII guard object.\n12. `Mutex<()>` and `RwLock<()>` allow raw locking without a RAII guard\n    object.\n13. `Mutex` and `RwLock` support [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)\n    which allows them to be fair on average without sacrificing performance.\n14. A `ReentrantMutex` type which supports recursive locking.\n15. An *experimental* deadlock detector that works for `Mutex`,\n    `RwLock` and `ReentrantMutex`. This feature is disabled by default and\n    can be enabled via the `deadlock_detection` feature.\n16. `RwLock` supports atomically upgrading an \"upgradable\" read lock into a\n    write lock.\n17. Optional support for [serde](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/). Enable via the\n    feature `serde`. **NOTE!** this support is for `Mutex`, `ReentrantMutex`,\n    and `RwLock` only; `Condvar` and `Once` are not currently supported.\n18. Lock guards can be sent to other threads when the `send_guard` feature is\n    enabled.\n\nThe parking lot\n---------------\n\nTo keep these primitives small, all thread queuing and suspending\nfunctionality is offloaded to the *parking lot*. The idea behind this is\nbased on the Webkit [`WTF::ParkingLot`](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/)\nclass, which essentially consists of a hash table mapping of lock addresses\nto queues of parked (sleeping) threads. The Webkit parking lot was itself\ninspired by Linux [futexes](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html),\nbut it is more powerful since it allows invoking callbacks while holding a queue\nlock."

Excerpts that discuss unsafe code and the five unsafe operations, as well as the general concept of UB in Rust, are also directly relevant because UBSan operates on UB concepts at runtime and these excerpts explain when UB can occur and how Rust enforces or permits UB through unsafe blocks.

You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

            "Since last fall, [Neven](https://perso.crans.org/vanille/) has been doing an internship to develop a new aliasing model for Rust: Tree Borrows. Hang on a second, I hear you say – doesn’t Rust already have an aliasing model? Isn’t there this “Stacked Borrows” that Ralf keeps talking about? Indeed there is, but Stacked Borrows is just one proposal for a possible aliasing model – and it [has](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/133) [its](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/134) [fair](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/256) [share](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/274) [of](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/276) [problems](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/303) .",
            "What’s more, we are treating _all_ mutable references as two-phase borrows: this is more permissive than what the borrow checker accepts, but lets us treat mutable references entirely uniformly. (This is a point we might want to tweak, but as we will see soon this decision actually has some major unexpected benefits.) This is why we need a tree in the first place: `arg0` and the reference passed to `Vec::len` are both children of `x` . A stack is no longer sufficient to represent the parent-child relationships here. Once the use of a tree is established, modeling of two-phase borrows is fairly intuitive: they start out in a `Reserved` state which tolerates reads from other, unrelated pointers. Only when the reference (or one of its children) is written to for the first time, its state transitions to `Active` and now reads from other, unrelated pointers are not accepted any more. (See Neven’s post for more details. In particular note that there is one unpleasant surprise lurking here: if there are `UnsafeCell` involved, then a reserved mutable reference actually has to tolerate _mutation_ via unrelated pointers! In other words, the aliasing rules of `&mut T` are now affected by the presence of `UnsafeCell` . I don’t think people realized this when two-phase borrows were introduced, but it also seems hard to avoid so even with hindsight, it is not clear what the alternative would have been.)",
            "Basically, raw pointers can live longer than the mutable references they are derived from, which is highly non-intuitive and potentially problematic for program analyses. With TB, the swapped program is still fine, but for a different reason:\nwhen `to` gets created first, it remains a reserved two-phase borrow. This means that creating a shared reference and deriving `from` from it (which acts like a read on `self` ) is fine; reserved two-phase borrows tolerate reads via unrelated pointers. Only when `to` is written to does it (or rather the `&mut self` it was created from) become an active mutable reference that requires uniqueness, but that is after `as_ptr` returns so there is no conflicting `&self` reference. It turns out that consistently using two-phase borrows lets us entirely eliminate this hacky SB rule and also fix one of the most common sources of UB under SB. I didn’t expect this at all, so this is a happy little accident. :)",
            "However, note that the following program is fine under SB but invalid under TB:\n\n```\nlet mut a = [ 0 , 1 ];\nlet to = a .as_mut_ptr () .add ( 1 );\nto .write ( 0 );\nlet from = a .as_ptr ();\nstd :: ptr :: copy_nonoverlapping ( from , to , 1 );\n```\n\nHere, the write to `to` activates the two-phase borrow, so uniqueness is enforced. That means the `&self` created for `as_ptr` (which is considered reading all of `self` ) is incompatible with `to` , and so `to` is invalidated (well, it is made read-only) when `from` gets created.\nSo far, we do not have evidence that this pattern is common in the wild. The way to avoid issues like the code above is to _set up all your raw pointers before you start doing anything_ . Under TB, calling reference-receiving methods like `as_ptr` and `as_mut_ptr` and using the raw pointers they return on disjoint locations is fine even if these references overlap, but you must call all those methods before the first write to a raw pointer. Once the first write happens, creating more references can cause aliasing violations. ## No strict confinement of the accessible memory range\n\nThe other major source of trouble with Stacked Borrows is [restricting raw pointers to the type and mutability they are initially created with](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/134) . Under SB, when a reference is cast to `*mut T` , the resulting raw pointer is confined to access only the memory covered by `T` . This regularly trips people up when they take a raw pointer to one element of an array (or one field of a struct) and then use pointer arithmetic to access neighboring elements. Moreover, when a reference is cast to `*const T` , it is actually read-only, even if the reference was mutable! Many people expect `*const` vs `*mut` not to matter for aliasing, so this is a regular source of confusion. Under TB, we resolve this by no longer doing any retagging for reference-to-raw-pointer casts.\nA raw pointer simply uses the same tag as the parent reference it is derived from, thereby inheriting its mutability and the range of addresses it can access. Moreover, references are not strictly confined to the memory range described by their type:\nwhen an `&mut T` (or `&T` ) gets created from a parent pointer, we initially record the new reference to be allowed to access the memory range describe by `T` (and we consider this a read access for that memory range). However, we also perform _lazy initialization_ : when a memory location outside this initial range is accessed, we check if the parent pointer would have had access to that location, and if so then we also give the child the same access. This is repeated recursively until we find a parent that has sufficient access, or we reach the root of the tree. This means TB is compatible with [`container_of` \\-style pointer arithmetic](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/243) and [`extern` types](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/276) , overcoming two more SB limitations. This also means that the following code becomes legal under TB:\n\n```\nlet mut x = 0 ;\nlet ptr = std :: ptr :: addr_of_mut! ( x );\nx = 1 ;\nptr .read ();\n```\n\nUnder SB, `ptr` and direct access to the local `x` used two different tags, so writing to the local invalidated all pointers to it.\nUnder TB, this is no longer the case; a raw pointer directly created to the local is allowed to alias arbitrarily with direct accesses to the local. Arguably the TB behavior is more intuitive, but it means we can no longer use writes to local variables as a signal that all possible aliases have been invalidated. However, note that TB only allows this if there is an `addr_of_mut` (or `addr_of` ) immediately in the body of a function! If a reference `&mut x` is created, and then some other function derives a raw pointer from that, those raw pointers _do_ get invalidated on the next write to `x` . So to me this is a perfect compromise: code that uses raw pointers has a lower risk of UB, but code that does not use raw pointers (which is easy to see syntactically) can be optimized as much as with SB. Note that this entire approach in TB relies on TB _not_ needing the stack-violating hack mentioned in the previous section. If raw pointers in SB just inherited their parent tag, then they would get invalidated together with the unique pointer they are derived from, disallowing all the code that this hack was specifically added to support. This means that backporting these improvements to SB is unlikely to be possible. ## `UnsafeCell`\n\nThe handling of `UnsafeCell` also changed quite a bit with TB.\nFirst of all, another [major issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/303) with SB was fixed: turning an `&i32` into an `&Cell<i32>` _and then never writing to it_ is finally allowed. This falls out of how TB handles the aliasing allowed with `UnsafeCell` : they are treated like casts to raw pointers, so reborrowing an `&Cell<i32>` just inherits the tag (and therefore the permissions) of the parent pointer. More controversially, TB also changes how precisely things become read-only when an `&T` involves `UnsafeCell` somewhere inside `T` . In particular, for `&(i32, Cell<i32>)` , TB allows mutating _both_ fields, including the first field which is a regular `i32` , since it just treats the entire reference as “this allows aliasing”. <sup>[1](:1)</sup> In contrast, SB actually figured out that the first 4 bytes are read-only and only the last 4 bytes allow mutation via aliased pointers. The reason for this design decision is that the general philosophy with TB was to err on the side of allowing more code, having less UB (which is the opposite direction than what I used with SB). This is a deliberate choice to uncover as much of the design space as we can with these two models. Of course we wanted to make sure that TB still allows all the desired optimizations, and still has enough UB to justify the LLVM IR that rustc generates – those were our “lower bounds” for the minimum amount of UB we need.\nAnd it turns out that under these constraints, we can support `UnsafeCell` with a fairly simple approach: for the aliasing rules of `&T` , there are only 2 cases. Either there is no `UnsafeCell` anywhere, then this reference is read-only, or else the reference allows aliasing. As someone who thinks a lot about proving theorems about the full Rust semantics including its aliasing model, this approach seemed pleasingly simple. :)"

Excerpts that introduce \"Stacked Borrows\" as an aliasing model for Rust clearly frame the model as a formalized discipline used to reason about memory access and safety. This constitutes a concrete modeling approach akin to a formal verification model, which is central to model checking. Relatedly, excerpts about Tree Borrows discuss an evolution of the aliasing model and its implications for safety and correctness, continuing the theme of formalized reasoning about memory aliasing and safety properties. Additionally, the Miri project is described as an interpreter that dynamically checks undefined behavior and safety guarantees in Rust, which aligns with the concept of runtime model checking or formal verification in practice, especially for verifying unsafe code and memory safety properties. The combination of these modeling efforts (Stacked/Tree Borrows) and runtime checking (Miri) provides multiple angles on model-based verification in Rust, which supports the research aim of exploring model checking-like approaches in Rust. Specific connections: - “Stacked Borrows defines an aliasing discipline and declares programs violating it to have undefined behavior,” which presents a formal model for aliasing that underpins verification discussions. - “Tree Borrows explains a newer aliasing model and discusses how it handles unsafe pointers and aliasing decisions, illustrating evolving formal models for safety.” - “Miri, an interpreter for Rust's mid-level IR, detects undefined behavior at runtime and helps verify safety properties beyond static checks,” illustrating a practical model-checking-style verification tool. - The recurrence of terms like “aliasing model,” “unsafe code,” and “undefined behavior” across these excerpts reinforces the framing of formal verification concepts in Rust. - While the excerpts do not always use the exact term “model checking,” they collectively provide the core components of model-based reasoning (formal models of memory aliasing) and runtime verification tools (Miri), which together embody the model-checking paradigm within Rust’s ecosystem.",

You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

Additional excerpts discuss the identifier system more broadly (ASCII subset, Unicode normalization) and the NFC normalization standard, which, while tangential, relate to the broader constraints around identifier naming and could underpin the “naming conventions” aspect in the field value. Taken together, these sources collectively substantiate the presence and distinctions of strict, reserved, and evolving keywords, and they provide concrete examples and rules (including raw identifiers and Unicode-based restrictions) that map cleanly to the requested field value. The most directly supportive parts are the exhaustive keyword lists and explicit notes about reserved/evolving keywords and raw identifiers, followed by the broader identifier guidelines that provide necessary context for naming conventions and Unicode rules.",

At a high level, the mutex is described as a mutual exclusion primitive used to protect shared data, and its typical usage is to create a guard that releases the lock when dropped. This aligns with the anti-pattern’s core idea: holding the guard across an await would extend the critical section into an await point, potentially causing deadlocks or unnecessary contention. The following excerpts are most relevant: the description of a mutex as a mutual exclusion primitive that protects shared data highlights that the guard governs access to protected data, and that the lock is released when the guard is dropped (implied by typical RAII semantics). The mentions of the mutex and its guard lifecycle (e.g., \"A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data\" and references to how locks and guards interact) provide the foundational context for why holding a guard across an await is risky. Additional excerpts discuss poisoning semantics and typical guard usage patterns, which reinforce the importance of timely guard release to avoid deadlock or poisoned states. Together, these excerpts support the idea that RAII guards should not be held across await points, because doing so can impede progress and introduce deadlock risk. The most directly relevant content establishes the mutex’s protective role and its guard-oriented usage, which underpins the anti-pattern’s rationale. The other excerpts provide broader context about ownership and borrowing semantics that further explain safe guard usage patterns, though they are less specific to the anti-pattern itself.",

Excerpts that discuss how traits are defined and used, and how visibility controls access to items, are directly relevant to understanding the feasibility and mechanism of sealing a trait. Specifically:\n- The Trait Defining Shared Behavior excerpt describes using traits to express abstract behavior and the role of bounds to constrain generic types. This foundation helps explain why one would want to “seal” the trait to control who can implement it, by tying implementations to restricted visibility. It highlights the mechanism by which a trait defines an interface and how that interface is typically consumed by generic bounds. Paraphrased: Traits define shared behavior and can be constrained via where clauses and bounds, which is the core around which a sealed pattern would wrap access to implementers.\n- The Visibility and Privacy excerpts explain visibility modifiers (pub, pub(in path), pub(crate), pub(self)) and how access to items is controlled within a crate or module. This is precisely the tooling used to implement a sealed trait: you make the implementing types or the trait’s implementors accessible only within a restricted scope (e.g., the crate), preventing downstream crates from providing new implementations. Paraphrased: Pub(crate) restricts visibility to the current crate, pub(super) to the parent module, and pub(self) to the current module, which provides the mechanism to enforce sealing by limiting who can implement or interact with the trait.\n- The combination of these concepts is what underpins a Sealed Trait Pattern in Rust: you expose a public trait but restrict its implementations through private or crate-scoped collaborators. The cited material on how traits are defined and how visibility controls access demonstrates the practical means by which a sealed trait could be implemented and reasoned about in Rust code.\n- Additional related context is provided by discussions on trait usage and associated patterns in the context of generic bounds and trait-based design, which helps explain how sealing a trait interacts with generic programming and type-level constraints without changing the fundamental trait mechanism itself.\nOverall, these excerpts collectively support understanding the Sealed Trait Pattern by detailing (a) what a trait is and how it expresses shared behavior, and (b) how visibility controls can be used to restrict implementations, which is the essence of the sealing concept.",

Specifically:\n- Excerpts detailing ownership as the breakout feature of Rust and how resources are managed (ownership transfers, single owner, and RAII) illuminate why duplicating data is often avoided when ownership and lifetimes are modeled properly.\n- Excerpts describing that there can be one owner at a time and how references and borrowing work (references guarantee validity, mutable vs. immutable borrows, and lifetime considerations) provide the foundation for why cloning can be an anti-pattern if it’s used to bypass borrowing constraints.\n- The borrow checker explanations (MIR-based checks and the rules about mutably/immutably borrowed places) illustrate the practical pain points that might tempt cloning but are best avoided by design changes that respect borrowing rules.\n- Additional context from references and borrowing discussions and the lifetime/elision material reinforces the idea that many cloning scenarios arise from trying to work around lifetimes and borrows rather than from actual needs of data duplication.\nGiven these excerpts, we can see that they support the general thesis that the anti-pattern of unnecessary cloning stems from suboptimal ownership/borrowing design, even though none of the excerpts explicitly call out the exact anti-pattern term.\nOverall, the strongest direct support for understanding why unnecessary cloning is an anti-pattern comes from the core explanations of ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and borrow-checker behavior, which underpin why duplicating data is often unnecessary and suboptimal.",

            "This library provides implementations of `Mutex`, `RwLock`, `Condvar` and\n`Once` that are smaller, faster and more flexible than those in the Rust\nstandard library, as well as a `ReentrantMutex` type which supports recursive\nlocking. It also exposes a low-level API for creating your own efficient\nsynchronization primitives.",
            "When tested on x86\\_64 Linux, `parking_lot::Mutex` was found to be 1.5x\nfaster than `std::sync::Mutex` when uncontended, and up to 5x faster when\ncontended from multiple threads. The numbers for `RwLock` vary depending on\nthe number of reader and writer threads, but are almost always faster than\nthe standard library `RwLock`, and even up to 50x faster in some cases.",
            "Features\n--------\n\nThe primitives provided by this library have several advantages over those\nin the Rust standard library:\n\n1. `Mutex` and `Once` only require 1 byte of storage space, while `Condvar`\n   and `RwLock` only require 1 word of storage space. On the other hand on\n   some platforms (macOS and a few others) the standard library primitives\n   require a dynamically allocated `Box` to hold OS-specific synchronization\n   primitives. The small size of `Mutex` in particular encourages the use\n   of fine-grained locks to increase parallelism.\n2. Uncontended lock acquisition and release is done through fast inline\n   paths which only require a single atomic operation.\n3. Microcontention (a contended lock with a short critical section) is\n   efficiently handled by spinning a few times while trying to acquire a\n   lock.\n4. The locks are adaptive and will suspend a thread after a few failed spin\n   attempts. This makes the locks suitable for both long and short critical\n   sections.\n5. `Condvar`, `RwLock` and `Once` work on Windows XP, unlike the standard\n   library versions of those types.\n6. `RwLock` takes advantage of hardware lock elision on processors that\n   support it, which can lead to huge performance wins with many readers.\n   This must be enabled with the `hardware-lock-elision` feature.\n7. `RwLock` uses a task-fair locking policy, which avoids reader and writer\n   starvation, whereas the standard library version makes no guarantees.\n8. `Condvar` is guaranteed not to produce spurious wakeups. A thread will\n   only be woken up if it timed out or it was woken up by a notification.\n9. `Condvar::notify_all` will only wake up a single thread and requeue the\n   rest to wait on the associated `Mutex`. This avoids a thundering herd\n   problem where all threads try to acquire the lock at the same time.\n10. `RwLock` supports atomically downgrading a write lock into a read lock.\n11. `Mutex` and `RwLock` allow raw unlocking without a RAII guard object.\n12. `Mutex<()>` and `RwLock<()>` allow raw locking without a RAII guard\n    object.\n13. `Mutex` and `RwLock` support [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)\n    which allows them to be fair on average without sacrificing performance.\n14. A `ReentrantMutex` type which supports recursive locking.\n15. An *experimental* deadlock detector that works for `Mutex`,\n    `RwLock` and `ReentrantMutex`. This feature is disabled by default and\n    can be enabled via the `deadlock_detection` feature.\n16. `RwLock` supports atomically upgrading an \"upgradable\" read lock into a\n    write lock.\n17. Optional support for [serde](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/). Enable via the\n    feature `serde`. **NOTE!** this support is for `Mutex`, `ReentrantMutex`,\n    and `RwLock` only; `Condvar` and `Once` are not currently supported.\n18. Lock guards can be sent to other threads when the `send_guard` feature is\n    enabled.\n\nThe parking lot\n---------------\n\nTo keep these primitives small, all thread queuing and suspending\nfunctionality is offloaded to the *parking lot*. The idea behind this is\nbased on the Webkit [`WTF::ParkingLot`](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/)\nclass, which essentially consists of a hash table mapping of lock addresses\nto queues of parked (sleeping) threads. The Webkit parking lot was itself\ninspired by Linux [futexes](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html),\nbut it is more powerful since it allows invoking callbacks while holding a queue\nlock.",

This requires Rust 1.59 due to the use of\ninline assembly.\n\nThe core parking lot API is provided by the `parking_lot_core` crate.

The synchronous/bounded channel variant (sync_channel) is a closely related channel primitive within the same std::sync::mpsc family, illustrating how MPSC channels can be bounded and block on sends, which is a key aspect of synchronous concurrency channels. Other excerpts provide general notes about channels and their usage, reinforcing the context that channels are the Rust mechanism for inter-thread communication, though they may be a step removed from the core MPSC reference. Overall, the most relevant material directly identifies and explains MPSC channels and their core types, while surrounding content offers supportive context on channel usage and variations.",

For example, the description of message-passing concurrency notes that channels send messages between threads, which is the essence of message passing in Rust. Related entries elaborate on concrete channel implementations and usage patterns: channels in std::sync::mpsc establish a multi-producer, single-consumer FIFO communication primitive, with cloneable Sender objects that allow many threads to send to a single Receiver, and Receiver side to receive messages. Channel creation details (creating bounded and unbounded channels) are also highly relevant, as they define how message passing is instantiated in Rust programs. Additional entries discuss the crossbeam ecosystem’s channels, which are designed for multi-producer/multi-consumer messaging and often provide improved performance, further validating the central concept of message passing in concurrent Rust. Finally, entries on sync_channel (a synchronous/bounded channel) and related channel semantics emphasize the behavioral aspects of message passing (blocking vs non-blocking, ordering, and ownership transfer) that are essential to this field value. Together, these excerpts collectively substantiate the core concept of message passing as a fundamental mechanism for inter-thread communication in Rust, including the roles of Sender/Receiver, multi-producer configurations, and the distinction between bounded and unbounded channels.",

In the excerpts, there are explicit discussions of contention, scheduling, and related phenomena. One excerpt explicitly mentions the thundering herd problem, which is a related contention scenario where many threads wake and contend for a lock simultaneously, potentially leading to some threads being effectively starved of progress. This directly touches on the practical risks behind starvation in lock-based synchronization. Additionally, a Rust-focused excerpt on race conditions outlines foundational ideas about concurrent access and the fact that unsafe or unsynchronized access can cause undefined behavior; while not named starvation, it provides the backdrop of why unfair or blocking access can lead to certain threads being perpetually postponed in practice. Another excerpt discusses race conditions more generally in the Rust context, describing how concurrent access without proper synchronization can lead to problematic scenarios, which can be related to starvation if certain threads are consistently preempted or blocked while others repeatedly proceed. Taken together, these excerpts provide partial but relevant grounding around issues that can contribute to starvation in concurrent Rust programs, through concepts like contention, locking behavior, and scheduling effects.",

Several excerpts discuss specific Crossbeam components like channels, queues, work-stealing deques, and epoch-based memory management, all of which are part of the Crossbeam suite. The most relevant portions are those that explicitly describe Crossbeam channels and Crossbeam as a concurrency toolkit, since they provide concrete evidence of Crossbeam’s role and its constituent crates. Less directly related excerpts discuss general concurrency topics or other libraries (e.g., std::sync primitives) but still mention Crossbeam in a broader ecosystem context, which helps situate crossbeam as a key keyword for end-to-end Rust concurrency research.

Additional excerpts mention the poisoned state within the mutex documentation, confirming its role as a safety mechanism in Rust’s synchronization story.

SwissTable-style layouts are known to improve locality by densely packing entries and reducing cache misses during probing. This supports the notion that such layouts aim to improve cache locality when accessing map entries.\n- The note that the hash table implementation is based on SwissTable also implies a design choice intended to improve spatial locality and access patterns, which are central to cache locality considerations in hash-based structures.\n- The general performance and cost tables for collections (e.g., Vec, HashMap) emphasize how operations scale (O(1) amortized for certain maps, and the trade-offs in insertion/lookup). While not explicitly mentioning cache locality, such performance characteristics are a direct consequence of underlying memory access patterns and layout decisions that affect cache efficiency.\n- Additional references to memory layout and representation (e.g., type layout discussions and how data is stored in structures) provide broader context for why certain layouts (contiguous storage, compact representations) influence cache locality in practice.\n- The excerpts about performance comparisons across collections (e.g., HashMap vs. BTreeMap, or deque-like versus vector-backed structures) implicitly touch on cache-friendly behavior: structures with more contiguous storage and predictable access patterns tend to exhibit better cache locality, which aligns with the theme of cache locality as a performance concern.\n- Taken together, these excerpts collectively support the notion that cache locality is a consideration in choosing and implementing data structures, particularly around memory layout, contiguity, and probing strategies, which are central to the concept of cache locality in Rust data structures.\n",

However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`.

            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

The excerpts about specific data structures and their performance tradeoffs (HashMap and its SwissTable-inspired implementation, Vec growth behavior, and the costs of different collection operations) demonstrate concrete mechanisms by which Rust achieves efficient abstractions in practice. The notes about growth strategies and reallocation costs (e.g., doubling capacity, amortized analysis) show how abstractions are engineered to pay near-zero costs on common paths, which is the essence of zero-cost abstractions. The broader performance comparisons across containers (Vec, VecDeque, BinaryHeap, HashMap, BTreeMap) provide context on where abstractions map to expected performance characteristics and when cost can be kept minimal.

When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example.",

In these excerpts, several pieces touch on memory management and concurrency-related memory handling, which can be related to pooling approaches even if they don’t use the exact term “memory pool.” Specifically:\n- Excerpts describing epoch-based garbage collection discuss deferring destruction of objects and reclaiming memory safely in concurrent contexts. This is conceptually aligned with pooling in that both involve controlled lifetime management and reuse of memory blocks across threads. The material highlights how memory is managed over time (epochs) to enable safe reuse, which is a fundamental idea behind pool-like memory reuse strategies.\n- Excerpts describing memory reclamation for concurrent data structures and the need to coordinate destruction across threads also map to pooling goals: avoiding frequent allocations and deallocations by reusing memory safely.\n- Excerpts about parking_lot and related synchronization primitives emphasize lightweight, efficient memory/resource management for locks and concurrency primitives. While not explicitly memory pools, these discussions touch on memory-efficiency goals and alternative allocation strategies that are often part of a broader memory-pooling approach in high-performance systems.\n- Additional items discuss general memory layout, aliasing, and how memory is managed in concurrent contexts. Pooling concepts often accompany such strategies to manage allocation pools or arenas for performance gains, so these excerpts provide contextual support for why memory pooling matters in Rust’s performance landscape.\nOverall, there is indirect support for memory-pooling-related ideas through discussions of memory reclamation, concurrency-safe memory management, and efficient synchronization primitives.

Therefore, the most relevant content directly anchors the ZST concept with a concrete example, while the other excerpts provide broader context about type layout and representations that underpin why ZST behave the way they do in memory layout and optimizations.",

For example, passages that describe performance characteristics, amortized costs, and practical profiling-oriented thinking map directly to profiling workflows, where you measure hot paths and optimize accordingly. Passages about cargo build profiles and related settings are relevant because profiling workflows are often integrated with build configurations, debuggable artifacts, and optimization levels that profiling tools rely on to produce meaningful measurements. The following connections illustrate the mapping: - Expressions about performance of standard library collections and general Rust performance offer targets and expectations that profiling would quantify or validate (e.g., how certain data structures perform in practice). - Passages that label content under “Performance” and discuss cost characteristics (e.g., O(1), O(n) trade-offs, amortized costs) provide concrete metrics that profiling tools seek to measure and explain. - Content mentioning build and profile settings (e.g., opt-level, debuginfo, and profile-related knobs in Cargo) anchors profiling workflows to the artifacts produced for profiling runs, including how much debugging information is emitted and what optimizations are applied. - Where excerpts discuss the relationship between profiling and practical tooling, such as references to profiling-oriented concepts or the existence of profiling heuristics, they further strengthen the alignment with the field value.",

Further, the excerpts describing memory orderings and fences illuminate how operations can be ordered with respect to other operations, which is essential to understanding how a volatile-like access would behave in practice (ensuring certain visibility guarantees and preventing certain re-orderings).

Another entry explicitly states that iterators are lazy, meaning creating an iterator itself does not perform work, and work is only done when consuming with methods like next. This lazy, on-demand behavior is essential for allocation-free chains because it implies that no allocations are performed merely by building a chain of iterators. A subsequent excerpt highlights common iterator adapters (map, take, filter) which further supports the idea that you can build complex pipelines without allocations until you actually collect. The example showing two-phase usage (next/back) demonstrates how iteration proceeds without eagerly allocating or materializing the entire sequence, which aligns with the allocation-free chain concept.

Identifiers are names\nof functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants,\nmacros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes. ### [Keywords Currently in Use]()\n\nThe following is a list of keywords currently in use, with their functionality\ndescribed.\n* `as` \\- perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing\n  an item, or rename items in `use` statements\n* `async` \\- return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread\n* `await` \\- suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready\n* `break` \\- exit a loop immediately\n* `const` \\- define constant items or constant raw pointers\n* `continue` \\- continue to the next loop iteration\n* `crate` \\- in a module path, refers to the crate root\n* `dyn` \\- dynamic dispatch to a trait object\n* `else` \\- fallback for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs\n* `enum` \\- define an enumeration\n* `extern` \\- link an external function or variable\n* `false` \\- Boolean false literal\n* `fn` \\- define a function or the function pointer type\n* `for` \\- loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a\n  higher-ranked lifetime\n* `if` \\- branch based on the result of a conditional expression\n* `impl` \\- implement inherent or trait functionality\n* `in` \\- part of `for` loop syntax\n* `let` \\- bind a variable\n* `loop` \\- loop unconditionally\n* `match` \\- match a value to patterns\n* `mod` \\- define a module\n* `move` \\- make a closure take ownership of all its captures\n* `mut` \\- denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings\n* `pub` \\- denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules\n* `ref` \\- bind by reference\n* `return` \\- return from function\n* `Self` \\- a type alias for the type we are defining or\nimplementing\n* `self` \\- method subject or current module\n* `static` \\- global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution\n* `struct` \\- define a structure\n* `super` \\- parent module of the current module\n* `trait` \\- define a trait\n* `true` \\- Boolean true literal\n* `type` \\- define a type alias or associated type\n* `union` \\- define a [union](../reference/items/unions.html) ; is only a keyword when used\n  in a union declaration\n* `unsafe` \\- denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations\n* `use` \\- bring symbols into scope; specify precise captures for generic and\n  lifetime bounds\n* `where` \\- denote clauses that constrain a type\n* `while` \\- loop conditionally based on the result of an expression\n\n### [Keywords Reserved for Future Use]()\n\nThe following keywords do not yet have any functionality but are reserved by\nRust for potential future use. * `abstract`\n* `become`\n* `box`\n* `do`\n* `final`\n* `gen`\n* `macro`\n* `override`\n* `priv`\n* `try`\n* `typeof`\n* `unsized`\n* `virtual`\n* `yield`\n\n### [Raw Identifiers]()\n\n_Raw identifiers_ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t\nnormally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

[Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

This directly aligns with the field value “raw pointers” in the unsafe/FFI context, indicating that raw pointers themselves are not safe to send across threads or share between threads without care. This establishes the core safety limitation associated with raw pointers in Rust. \n- Additional context notes that UnsafeCell and certain types (like Rc) interact with thread-safety and trait bounds, underscoring broader safety discipline around sharing mutable state and the role of unsafe constructs like raw pointers. This reinforces why raw pointers require careful handling in safe Rust contexts and are a notable exception to Send/Sync guarantees. \n- General discussion of Send and Sync in the Nomicon explains the baseline expectations for thread-safety and what kinds of types are typically safe to share across threads. Raw pointers are highlighted as exceptions, which directly supports the notion that they are a special-case in Rust’s safety model. \n- Supplemental material on these topics (including explicit notes that raw pointers are not Send/Sync and related commentary) further corroborates the core claim that raw pointers carry inherent safety concerns and must be treated with care when crossing thread boundaries or interfacing with foreign code. This helps connect the field value to the practical safety implications of using raw pointers in unsafe contexts. \n- Additional notes emphasize that while some types can automatically derive Send/Sync, raw pointers themselves do not enjoy those guarantees, reinforcing the need to manage their usage carefully in unsafe blocks and across FFI boundaries.",

This is intended to answer the question which pointer may be used when to perform which kinds of memory accesses. This is a long-standing open question of many unsafe code authors, and also by compiler authors who want to add more optimizations. The model I am proposing here is by far not the first attempt at giving a definition: The model is heavily based on ideas by [@arielb1](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-memory-model/issues/26) and [@ubsan](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-memory-model/issues/28) , and of course taking into account the lessons I [learned last year](/blog/2017/08/11/types-as-contracts-evaluation.html) when I took my first stab at defining such a model, dubbed [“Types as Contracts”](/blog/2017/07/17/types-as-contracts.html) .",

When _specifying_ program behavior, we can work with an [“instrumented machine”](/blog/2017/06/06/MIR-semantics.html) that has extra state which is not present on the real machine, as long as we only use that extra state to define whether a program is UB or not:\nOn real hardware, we can ignore programs that are UB (they may just do whatever), so the extra state does not matter. Tags are something I wanted to avoid in “Types as Contracts” – that was one of the initial design constraints I had put upon myself, in the hope of avoiding the trouble coming with “complicated pointers”. However, I now came to the conclusion that tagging pointers is a price worth paying if it means we can make lifetimes irrelevant.",

Several excerpts explicitly introduce Stacked Borrows as an aliasing model and discuss its purpose of allowing memory accesses to be sound by tracking borrow tags over time. For instance, excerpts describe that Stack ed Borrows is a model for defining which kinds of aliasing are allowed in Rust and that it uses a stack of borrows, with concepts like barriers and retagging to ensure that different references to the same memory location have distinct identities and lifetimes. This supports the idea that Stack ed Borrows is an operational semantics designed to reason about memory safety in the presence of unsafe code. Other excerpts expand on the mechanics: the notion of reserving a path (a reserved borrow) before it is activated into a mutable borrow, the idea that a reference’s tag can be retagged to reflect its current ownership state, and the enforcement that these tags must remain distinct to prevent UB. Additional excerpts discuss concrete examples and the relationship to two-phase borrowing, where a mutable borrow is reserved first and only later activated, aligning with the Stack ed Borrows framework. Together, these excerpts directly support the field value by describing both the core concept (an aliasing model for Rust called Stack ed Borrows) and the mechanisms (borrows/tags, retagging, barriers, two-phase borrowing) that define its behavior in Rust’s memory model, including unsafe contexts.",

Related lines emphasize that certain operations involving raw pointers require unsafe blocks and that FFI boundaries commonly involve unsafe usage. Specifically, raw pointers are described as not automatically safe to share across threads (not Send/Sync), and foreign function calls are explicitly flagged as unsafe, requiring unsafe blocks. These pieces together underpin the notion that dereferencing raw pointers in unsafe/FFI contexts is an inherently unsafe operation and must be guarded by unsafe code and careful design. In addition, notes about how Rc is not Send/Sync and about UnsafeCell not being Sync reinforce the broader safety semantics around raw pointers and interior mutability when interfacing with unsafe code.

Another excerpt clarifies related points about Rust’s general concurrency guarantees: certain primitives like UnsafeCell are exceptions to Send/Sync, and standard smart pointers like Rc are not Send or Sync, which helps explain why raw pointers require careful handling in multithreaded or cross-FFI scenarios. A further excerpt notes that Send and Sync are properties that can be derived for types composed of Send/Sync components, which sets a boundary condition: if your type is entirely made of Send/Sync parts, it can be Send/Sync, but a bare raw pointer by itself does not automatically confer those guarantees and thus must be treated with explicit safety. Collectively, these excerpts establish the framework: the field value *const T identifies a raw pointer type whose cross-thread or cross-FFI usage is governed by explicit unsafe guarantees rather than implicit Send/Sync semantics, which is precisely why such a field is categorized under unsafe Rust and FFI considerations.",

Excerpts that articulate ownership and how values are moved, borrowed, or dropped establish the baseline for understanding provenance: they explain who owns what, when it is dropped, and how references may or may not outlive their referents. This is crucial for provenance because unsafe code can bypass some of Rust’s safety checks, making the careful accounting of ownership and lifetimes even more important to prevent undefined behavior. Discussions of references, lifetimes, and the rules that govern when a reference can be used (and when it cannot) directly illuminate how provenance is preserved or violated in unsafe contexts. Aliasing discussions are central to provenance because they describe when multiple references may refer to the same memory location and under what conditions that is safe. The material on two-phase borrows and the Stacked Borrows model provides deeper insight into how the provenance of references is tracked across calls and across potential mutability, which is especially relevant for unsafe code that interoperates with foreign interfaces. The cited ownership and lifetime discussions establish the fundamental provenance concepts (ownership transfer, borrowing, lifetimes, and what makes a reference valid), while the aliasing and two-phase/stacked borrows materials connect those concepts to unsafe contexts where provenance guarantees are at risk or need enforcement. The combination of these excerpts supports the idea that provenance in unsafe Rust/FFI hinges on strict tracking of who owns, borrows, and can mutate memory, and on how advanced borrowing models either preserve or threaten those guarantees in edge cases.",

However it's important that they aren't thread-safe to prevent types that\ncontain them from being automatically marked as thread-safe. These types have\nnon-trivial untracked ownership, and it's unlikely that their author was\nnecessarily thinking hard about thread safety.

It emphasizes that many primitives are Send and Sync by default, but there are notable exceptions (such as raw pointers) that can undermine safe concurrency. This directly bears on data races because raw pointers and unsynchronized access to shared data can lead to races when used across threads. The content states that raw pointers are neither Send nor Sync, which is a core constraint preventing safe concurrent access when not carefully synchronized.\n- Building on that, the Nomicon overview of Send and Sync reiterates that some primitives (notably raw pointers) are not thread-safe, reinforcing the conditions under which data races may occur if you bypass these guarantees.\n- The discussion about raw pointers further clarifies the risk: raw pointers do not provide safety guarantees, so using them across threads without proper synchronization can cause data races. This is a cornerstone in understanding data race risk in unsafe code paths and FFI boundaries.\n- An understanding of aliasing and its relation to undefined behavior in Rust’s unsafe contexts is provided in the Aliasing section of The Rustonomicon. It defines what aliasing means in practice and points out that certain aliasing patterns are UB, which can manifest as data races in concurrent scenarios if multiple mutable aliases access shared data unsafely.\n- The section on two-phase borrows and related borrow-checker behavior (Two-phase borrows) informs how Rust handles concurrent access patterns and how safety constraints are enforced during function calls. While not explicitly stating data races, it elucidates how borrow semantics constrain concurrent access and can influence the presence or absence of races in code that interacts with shared data across threads.\n- The remaining items concern broader concurrency and memory-safety themes (e.g., coherence, orphan rules, and general concurrency primitives). They provide context about how the language enforces safety in a multi-threaded setting, which is indirectly relevant to whether data races can occur depending on how types and traits are implemented across crates and how concurrency primitives are used.\n",

These excerpts reinforce the same safety narrative, showing how lifetime rules and borrowing semantics prevent pointers from becoming dangling. Collectively, they support the interpretation that dangling pointers are a central motivation for Rust’s ownership/borrowing design, particularly when interfacing with unsafe code or FFI. Direct evidence is strongest in the one excerpt that explicitly calls out dangling pointers, while the others provide the surrounding mechanism context that explains why such pointers are prevented in practice.

The explicit notes on allocation strategy and reallocation timing illustrate the core motivation for considering alternative allocators like bump/arena: to reduce reallocation overhead and fragmentation, improve locality, and control lifetime of allocations in a known region. Contextual passages about general collection performance (HashMap/Vec) also relate to how allocator choices influence overall performance, though they are less about allocation strategy per se and more about operation costs impacted by allocation behavior. Therefore, the strongest support comes from discussions of vector growth and reallocations, followed by broader performance notes on collection implementations which are influenced by allocator behavior.

This exact framing ties the field value to the practical guarantee that the wrapped value’s layout should be preserved and that the outer wrapper does not introduce additional padding or reordering beyond what the inner field would dictate. Related passages further describe what “transparent” means in practice: two excerpts emphasize that a type with the transparent representation shares the same layout/ABI as its single field, and that this representation defines how the type’s layout is aligned with the inner field’s representation. These connections show that the field value corresponds to an explicit, documented layout guarantee used for interop and low-level layout control, which is particularly salient in unsafe and FFI contexts where precise ABI compatibility matters. There is also contextual material on alternative representations (like C) to illustrate the spectrum of repr options and how they differ, reinforcing why a programmer would choose repr(transparent) for a type intended to behave like its sole field across FFI boundaries.

Furthermore, the description of workspaces highlights practical inheritance implications, such as the ability to run common commands across all workspace members and the sharing of a single Cargo.lock and a common output directory, which illustrate the virtual or inherited properties across the workspace boundary. Additional context from related excerpts shows how workspaces relate to root manifests and certain sections like [patch], [replace], and [profile.*], which are recognized at the root manifest level and apply to member crates, reinforcing the idea of inherited configuration within a workspace.

Other packages need to link to C libraries which can either be\nlocated on the system or possibly need to be built from source. Others still\nneed facilities for functionality such as code generation before building (think\nparser generators).\nCargo does not aim to replace other tools that are well-optimized for these\ntasks, but it does integrate with them with custom build scripts. Placing a\nfile named\nbuild.rs in the root of a package will cause Cargo to compile\nthat script and execute it just before building the package.",
            "Some example use cases of build scripts are:\n    * Building a bundled C library.\n    * Finding a C library on the host system.\n    * Generating a Rust module from a specification.\n    * Performing any platform-specific configuration needed for the crate.",
            "Life Cycle of a Build Script\nJust before a package is built, Cargo will compile a build script into an\nexecutable (if it has not already been built). It will then run the script,\nwhich may perform any number of tasks. The script may communicate with Cargo\nby printing specially formatted commands prefixed with\ncargo:: to stdout.\nThe build script will be rebuilt if any of its source files or dependencies\nchange.\nBy default, Cargo will re-run the build script if any of the files in the\npackage changes. Typically it is best to use the\nrerun-if commands,\ndescribed in the change detection section below, to\nnarrow the focus of what triggers a build script to run again.\nOnce the build script successfully finishes executing, the rest of the package\nwill be compiled. Scripts should exit with a non-zero exit code to halt the\nbuild if there is an error, in which case the build script’s output will be\ndisplayed on the terminal.",
            "Inputs to the Build Script\nWhen the build script is run, there are a number of inputs to the build script,\nall passed in the form of environment variables .\nIn addition to environment variables, the build script’s current directory is\nthe source directory of the build script’s package.",

Scripts\nshould not modify any files outside of that directory.\nBuild scripts communicate with Cargo by printing to stdout. Cargo will\ninterpret each line that starts with\ncargo:: as an instruction that will\ninfluence compilation of the package. All other lines are ignored.\nThe order of\ncargo:: instructions printed by the build script may affect the order of arguments that\ncargo passes to\nrustc . In turn, the\norder of arguments passed to\nrustc may affect the order of arguments passed\nto the linker. Therefore, you will want to pay attention to the order of the\nbuild script’s instructions. For example, if object\nfoo needs to link against\nlibrary\nbar , you may want to make sure that library\nbar ’s\ncargo::rustc-link-lib instruction appears after instructions to link object\nfoo .\nThe output of the script is hidden from the terminal during normal\ncompilation. If you would like to see the output directly in your terminal,\ninvoke Cargo as “very verbose” with the\n-vv flag. This only happens when the\nbuild script is run. If Cargo determines nothing has changed, it will not\nre-run the script, see change detection below for more.\nAll the lines printed to stdout by a build script are written to a file like\ntarget/debug/build/<pkg>/output (the precise location may depend on your\nconfiguration).

As such, they cannot be used as identifiers (except\nas raw identifiers as we’ll discuss in the “ [Raw\nIdentifiers]() ” section). Identifiers are names\nof functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants,\nmacros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes. ### [Keywords Currently in Use]()\n\nThe following is a list of keywords currently in use, with their functionality\ndescribed.\n* `as` \\- perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing\n  an item, or rename items in `use` statements\n* `async` \\- return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread\n* `await` \\- suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready\n* `break` \\- exit a loop immediately\n* `const` \\- define constant items or constant raw pointers\n* `continue` \\- continue to the next loop iteration\n* `crate` \\- in a module path, refers to the crate root\n* `dyn` \\- dynamic dispatch to a trait object\n* `else` \\- fallback for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs\n* `enum` \\- define an enumeration\n* `extern` \\- link an external function or variable\n* `false` \\- Boolean false literal\n* `fn` \\- define a function or the function pointer type\n* `for` \\- loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a\n  higher-ranked lifetime\n* `if` \\- branch based on the result of a conditional expression\n* `impl` \\- implement inherent or trait functionality\n* `in` \\- part of `for` loop syntax\n* `let` \\- bind a variable\n* `loop` \\- loop unconditionally\n* `match` \\- match a value to patterns\n* `mod` \\- define a module\n* `move` \\- make a closure take ownership of all its captures\n* `mut` \\- denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings\n* `pub` \\- denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules\n* `ref` \\- bind by reference\n* `return` \\- return from function\n* `Self` \\- a type alias for the type we are defining or\nimplementing\n* `self` \\- method subject or current module\n* `static` \\- global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution\n* `struct` \\- define a structure\n* `super` \\- parent module of the current module\n* `trait` \\- define a trait\n* `true` \\- Boolean true literal\n* `type` \\- define a type alias or associated type\n* `union` \\- define a [union](../reference/items/unions.html) ; is only a keyword when used\n  in a union declaration\n* `unsafe` \\- denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations\n* `use` \\- bring symbols into scope; specify precise captures for generic and\n  lifetime bounds\n* `where` \\- denote clauses that constrain a type\n* `while` \\- loop conditionally based on the result of an expression\n\n### [Keywords Reserved for Future Use]()\n\nThe following keywords do not yet have any functionality but are reserved by\nRust for potential future use. * `abstract`\n* `become`\n* `box`\n* `do`\n* `final`\n* `gen`\n* `macro`\n* `override`\n* `priv`\n* `try`\n* `typeof`\n* `unsized`\n* `virtual`\n* `yield`\n\n### [Raw Identifiers]()\n\n_Raw identifiers_ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t\nnormally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

Direct evidence about these concepts appears in excerpts that define and describe the keywords that govern module/crate usage. Specifically, one excerpt presents a keyword entry for the crate keyword and shows that it is a reserved or meaningful keyword (KW_CRATE : `crate`), which ties directly to the concept of crates and the crate root. Another excerpt provides a keyword entry for the mod keyword (KW_MOD : `mod`), which is central to Rust’s module system and how modules are organized and referenced. A third excerpt connects to the broader idea that keywords include references to crate and module usage and their role in identifiers, reinforcing how modules and crates are represented in code. The fourth excerpt discusses that keywords are reserved and cannot always be used as identifiers, which is relevant to understanding constraints when naming modules or crates and the packaging/structure implications in Rust. Together, these excerpts establish that modules are referenced via the mod keyword, crates via the crate keyword, and that they interact with identifier rules and the module/crate root concept, aligning with the finegrained field value about Modules, Crates, and Packages. The most direct support comes from the explicit KW_CRATE and KW_MOD definitions, followed by contextual explanations about their roles in module paths and crate roots, with additional corroboration from discussions about identifiers and reserved keywords that influence how modules and crates are named and organized in Rust.",

            "The key insight is that, today, when we execute the mutable borrow of\n`vec`, we start a borrow **immediately**, even though the reference\n(`arg0`, here) is not going to be used until later:\n\n```\n/* 0 */ tmp0 = &mut vec;   // mutable borrow created here..\n/* 1 */ tmp1 = &vec; // <-- shared borrow overlaps here         |\n/* 2 */ tmp2 = Vec::len(tmp1); //                               |\n/* 3 */ Vec::push(tmp0, tmp2); // ..but not used until here! ```\n\nThe proposal – which I will call **two-phased mutable borrows** – is\nto modify the borrow-checker so that mutable borrows operate in **two\nphases**:\n\n* When an `&mut` reference is first created, but before it is used,\n  the borrowed path (e.g., `vec`) is considered **reserved**. A\n  reserved path is subject to the same restrictions as a shared borrow\n  – reads are ok, but moves and writes are not (except under a\n  `Cell`). * Once you start using the reference in some way, the path is\n  considered **mutably borrowed** and is subject to the usual\n  restrictions. So, in terms of our example, when we execute the MIR statement `tmp0 = &mut vec`, that creates a **reservation** on `vec`, but doesn’t start\nthe actual borrow yet. `tmp0` is not used until line 3, so that means\nthat for lines 1 and 2, `vec` is only reserved. Therefore, it’s ok to\nshare `vec` (as line 1 does) so long as the resulting reference\n(`tmp1`) is dead as we enter line 3. Since `tmp1` is only used to call\n`Vec::len()`, we’re all set!"

If a trait has a [supertrait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html) you can coerce a reference to said trait object to a reference to a trait object of the supertrait:\n\n```\ntrait Trait: Supertrait {}\ntrait Supertrait {}\n\nfn upcast(x: &dyn Trait) -> &dyn Supertrait {\n    x\n}\n```\n\nThe same would work with any other kind of (smart-)pointer, like `Arc<dyn Trait> -> Arc<dyn Supertrait>` or `*const dyn Trait -> *const dyn Supertrait`. Previously this would have required a workaround in the form of an `upcast` method in the `Trait` itself, for example `fn as_supertrait(&self) -> &dyn Supertrait`, and this would work only for one kind of reference/pointer. Such workarounds are not necessary anymore. Note that this means that raw pointers to trait objects carry a non-trivial invariant: \"leaking\" a raw pointer to a trait object with an invalid vtable into safe code may lead to undefined behavior. It is not decided yet whether creating such a raw pointer temporarily in well-controlled circumstances causes immediate undefined behavior, so code should refrain from creating such pointers under any conditions (and Miri enforces that).",

But you can implement `Display` for `MyType` , because you defined `MyType` . However, if you define your own trait `MyTrait` , then you can implement `MyTrait` for any type you like, including external types like `Vec<T>` .

            "[The Orphan Rules]()\n\nIn order to model the orphan check in chalk, we need a precise description of the orphan rules as they are implemented in rustc today. There are several resources which can be used to figure out the orphan rules in rustc.\n* [RFC 1023: Rebalancing Coherence](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1023-rebalancing-coherence.html)\n* [_Trait Implementation Coherence_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html) [in the](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html) [_Rust Reference_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/implementations.html)\n* [E0210: A violation of the orphan rules in the](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html) [_Rust Error Index_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html)\n* [_Little Orphan Impls_](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/) [by Niko Matsakis](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2015/01/14/little-orphan-impls/)\n\nOf all of these, RFC 1023 is probably considered the most authoritative source on the orphan rules. The orphan rules as proposed in that RFC are as follows:\n\nGiven an impl `impl<T1...Tn> Trait<P1...Pn> for P0` , either `Trait` must be local to the current crate, or:\n\n1. At least one type must meet the `LT` pattern defined above. Let `Pi` be the first such type. 2. No type parameters `T1...Tn` may appear in the type parameters that precede `Pi` (that is, `Pj` where `j < i` ). The `LT` pattern being referred to basically means that the type is a “local type” including the affects of fundamental types. That means that `Ti` is either a local type, or a fundamental type whose first parameter is a local type. This definition is good.\nOnce you read it a few times and it makes sense, it is fairly unambiguous. That being said, the RFC was written quite a while ago and we have since found [unsoundness](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43355) in some of the parts of the compiler that were implemented based on that RFC. Thus, it is probably best to look at the only _truly authoritative_ source on the Rust compiler: the rustc source code itself! Indeed, if you think of the rustc source code as an executable specification of how the Rust programming language is meant to work, you can look at it and determine the true behaviour of the orphan rules. ## [The Orphan Check in rustc]()\n\nThe orphan check as implemented today in the Rust compiler takes place in the [`orphan_check`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b7c6e8f1805cd8a4b0a1c1f22f17a89e9e2cea23/src/librustc/traits/coherence.rs) function which is called [for every declared impl](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b7c6e8f1805cd8a4b0a1c1f22f17a89e9e2cea23/src/librustc_typeck/coherence/orphan.rs) . Since implementations for locally defined traits are always defined, that function returns OK if the trait being implemented is local. Otherwise, it dispatches to the [`orphan_check_trait_ref`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b7c6e8f1805cd8a4b0a1c1f22f17a89e9e2cea23/src/librustc/traits/coherence.rs) function which does the major orphan rules checking. Recall that the impls we are dealing with are in the form `impl<T0…Tn> Trait<P1…Pn> for P0` .\nThe `orphan_check_trait_ref` function takes a **trait ref** which is essentially `Trait` and its parameters `P0…Pn` (notice that the `Self` type `P0` is included). The parameters `P0…Pn` are known as the **input types** of the trait. The function goes through each input type from `P0` to `Pn` looking for the first local type `Pi` . For each type parameter `Pj` found before that, the function checks that it does not contain any of the placeholder types `T0…Tn` at any level. That means that `Pj` cannot have any of the types `T0…Tn` at any level recursively. When the first local type `Pi` is found, we check to make sure any type parameters used in it are covered by a local type. Since we don’t have any fundamental types with more than one type parameter, this check is probably extraneous.\n## [The Orphan Rules in rustc]()\n\nThus, based on the source code, the orphan rules in Rust are as follows:\n\nGiven an impl of the form `impl<T0…Tn> Trait<P1…Pn> for P0` , the impl is allowed if:\n\n* `Trait` is local to the current crate\n* `Trait` is upstream to the current crate and:\n      + There is at least one type parameter `Pi` which, taking fundamental types into account, is **local** to the current crate\n      + Within the type `Pi` , all type parameters are covered by `Pi`\n                - This only really applies if we allowed fundamental types with multiple type parameters\n                - Since we don’t do that yet, we can ignore this for the time being\n      + All types `Pj` such that `j < i` do not contain `T0…Tn` at any level of depth (i.e. the types are **fully visible** **—** “visible” meaning that the type is a known type and not a type parameter or variable)\n\n## [Modeling The Orphan Check]()\n\nDetermining how to model these rules in chalk is actually quite straightforward at this point. We have an exact specification of how the rules are meant to work and we can translate that directly. Here’s how the lowering rules would look:\n\nFor each trait `Trait` ,\n\n* If `Trait` is local to the current crate, we generate: `forall<Self, P1…Pn> { LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) }` This models that any impls are allowed if the trait is local to the current crate.\n* If `Trait` is upstream to the current crate, we need a rule which models the additional conditions on which impls are allowed:\n\n```ignore\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> { LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :- IsLocal(Self) }\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :- IsFullyVisible(Self), IsLocal(P1)\n}\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    IsLocal(P2)\n}\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    IsFullyVisible(P2),\n    IsLocal(P3)\n}\n...\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  LocalImplAllowed(Self: Trait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    IsFullyVisible(P2),\n    ...\n    IsFullyVisible(Pn-1),\n    IsLocal(Pn)\n}\n```\n\nHere, we have modeled every possible case of `P1` to `Pn` being local and then checked if all prior type parameters are fully visible. This truly is a direct translation of the rules listed above! Now, to complete the orphan check, we can iterate over each impl of the same form as before and check if `LocalImplAllowed(P0: Trait<P1…Pn>)` is provable. # [Chalk: Overlap Check]()\n\n> Note: A key assumption for the overlap check is that the orphan check runs before it. That means that any impl that the overlap check encounters already abides by the orphan rules.\n ... \nThe issue is that there may very well not be any such impl at this current time. In that case, chalk will conclude that these two impls do not overlap. This is an issue because that is certainly an impl that could be added later, so this conclusion may be too strong. Why is that we’re only saying that this conclusion _may_ be too strong? Well we’re using “may” because it depends on what we want to assume about different crates. The orphan rules make it so that upstream crates can add certain impls to themselves in a semver compatible way. In particular, upstream crates can add impls of upstream traits for their own upstream types without having to worry about breaking downstream code. That means that we can’t just assume that upstream type doesn’t implement an upstream trait. This particular assumption is too strong. On the other hand, the orphan rules permit the current crate to add certain impls as well. A property of the orphan rules is that the impls it allows are only allowed to be defined in a single crate. So that means that if the impls allowed by the orphan rules in the current crate don’t exist, it is perfectly safe to assume that they are not there. The conclusion from all of this is that it is perfectly safe to rule out impls that can be defined in the current crate, but we can’t do the same for impls in any other crate.\n ... \nWe can do this by enumerating the possibilities generated from the orphan rules specified above:\n\n```ignore\n// Given a trait MyTrait<P1...Pn> where WCs\n\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  Implemented(Self: MyTrait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    WCs,                  // where clauses\n    Compatible,\n    DownstreamType(Self), // local to a downstream crate\n    CannotProve,\n}\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  Implemented(Self: MyTrait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    WCs,\n    Compatible,\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    DownstreamType(P1),\n    CannotProve,\n}\n...\nforall<Self, P1...Pn> {\n  Implemented(Self: MyTrait<P1...Pn>) :-\n    WCs,\n    Compatible,\n    IsFullyVisible(Self),\n    IsFullyVisible(P1),\n    ...,\n    IsFullyVisible(Pn-1),\n    DownstreamType(Pn),\n    CannotProve,\n}\n```\n\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, `IsFullyVisible` works here too. This is because our previous definition of the lowering for `IsFullyVisible` was quite broad. By lowering _all_ types in the current crate and in upstream crates with `IsFullyVisible` , that predicate covers the correct set of types here too. The orphan rules only require that there are no types parameters prior to the first local type. Types that are not type parameters and also by definition not downstream types are all of the types in the current crate and in upstream crates. This is exactly what `IsFullyVisible` covers. Fundamental types in both the current crate and in upstream crates can be considered local in a downstream crate if they are provided with a downstream type."

            "Rust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)\n\nAn enum is said to be _field-less_ if none of its variants have associated data. By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."

When\ninterfacing with C, pointers that might be `null` are often used, which would seem to\nrequire some messy `transmute`s and/or unsafe code to handle conversions to/from Rust types. However, trying to construct/work with these invalid values **is undefined behavior**,\nso you should use the following workaround instead. As a special case, an `enum` is eligible for the \"nullable pointer optimization\" if it contains\nexactly two variants, one of which contains no data and the other contains a field of one of the\nnon-nullable types listed above. This means no extra space is required for a discriminant; rather,\nthe empty variant is represented by putting a `null` value into the non-nullable field. This is\ncalled an \"optimization\", but unlike other optimizations it is guaranteed to apply to eligible\ntypes. The most common type that takes advantage of the nullable pointer optimization is `Option<T>`,\nwhere `None` corresponds to `null`. So `Option<extern \"C\" fn(c_int) -> c_int>` is a correct way\nto represent a nullable function pointer using the C ABI (corresponding to the C type\n`int (*)(int)`). Here is a contrived example.",

Calling operations that add to a collection will occasionally require a\ncollection to be resized - an extra operation that takes *O*(*n*) time.\n*Amortized* costs are calculated to account for the time cost of such resize\noperations *over a sufficiently large series of operations*. An individual\noperation may be slower or faster due to the sporadic nature of collection\nresizing, however the average cost per operation will approach the amortized\ncost. Rust’s collections never automatically shrink, so removal operations aren’t\namortized. [`HashMap`](struct.HashMap.html \"struct std::collections::HashMap\") uses *expected* costs. It is theoretically possible, though very\nunlikely, for [`HashMap`](struct.HashMap.html \"struct std::collections::HashMap\") to experience significantly worse performance than\nthe expected cost.

            "In contrast to the [previous](../rust-btree-case/) post, which dove into Rust’s BTreeMap and the idea of B-Trees in general, this post will be split up into two posts. In this post we will take a look at the general problems faced by hashtables, as well as the robin hood hashtable scheme. In the next post, we will take a high-to-mid-level look at Rust’s standard HashMap implementation (surprise, it’s a robin hood hashtable), and what it does to be safe and fast.",
            "We hash ~ alpha\\*n elements into a table of size n where each probe is independent and uniformly distributed over the table, and alpha < 1 is a constant. Let M be the maximum search time for any of the elements in the table. We show that with probability tending to one, M is in [log2log n + a, log2log n + b] for some constants *a* and *b* depending upon alpha only. This is an exponential improvement over the maximum search time in case of the standard FCFS collision strategy. So the expected worst-case search time is O(loglog n) if we have at most some constant load factor",
            "For all intents and purposes, we’ve got constant-time searches.",
            "For performance and simplicity, I recommend a robinhood hashmap, which enjoys O(1) expected time per query without the need for chaining.",
            "For security, I recommend SipHash 2-4 as a reasonable *default* hashing algorithm, with some way to override the default for performance."

            "Just looking at this `select!` example; what are the exact conditions that are required to achieve cancel safety (or not)? My assumption is that iff `read_msg()` 's `Future` does not store any of the data from its underlying transport in itself, then it's cancel safe. (I.e. it's safe if it will only extract data from its underlying transport when a complete message can be returned immediately using `Poll::Ready` ). Is cancel non-safety an effect of a partial buffer being extracted and stored in the returned `Future` (by `read_msg()` ) but then `wait_for_kill` sneaks in and yields `Pending::Ready` ?

            "The easy way to avoid this is for the futures in the `select!` to not own state, but to borrow it from elsewhere; for example, if `buffered_stream` owns all the state, and the future returned by `read_msg()` mutates `buffered_stream` instead of storing its own state, you're cancellation-safe.",

            "Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for\nhandling situations in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust requires\nyou to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your\ncode will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust by ensuring\nthat you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before deploying your\ncode to production! Rust groups errors into two major categories: _recoverable_ and _unrecoverable_ errors. For a recoverable error, such as a _file not found_ error, we most\nlikely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation. Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access a\nlocation beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the\nprogram. Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle\nboth in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn’t have\nexcep",
            "Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and\nthe `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an\nunrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling `panic!` first and then talks\nabout returning `Result<T, E>` values. Additionally, we’ll explore\nconsiderations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to stop\nexecution."

However raw pointers are, strictly\nspeaking, marked as thread-unsafe as more of a _lint_ . Doing anything useful\nwith a raw pointer requires dereferencing it, which is already unsafe. In that\nsense, one could argue that it would be \"fine\" for them to be marked as thread\nsafe. However it's important that they aren't thread-safe to prevent types that\ncontain them from being automatically marked as thread-safe. These types have\nnon-trivial untracked ownership, and it's unlikely that their author was\nnecessarily thinking hard about thread safety.

It also exposes a low-level API for creating your own efficient\nsynchronization primitives.",
            "When tested on x86\\_64 Linux, `parking_lot::Mutex` was found to be 1.5x\nfaster than `std::sync::Mutex` when uncontended, and up to 5x faster when\ncontended from multiple threads. The numbers for `RwLock` vary depending on\nthe number of reader and writer threads, but are almost always faster than\nthe standard library `RwLock`, and even up to 50x faster in some cases.",
            "Features\n--------\n\nThe primitives provided by this library have several advantages over those\nin the Rust standard library:\n\n1. `Mutex` and `Once` only require 1 byte of storage space, while `Condvar`\n   and `RwLock` only require 1 word of storage space. On the other hand on\n   some platforms (macOS and a few others) the standard library primitives\n   require a dynamically allocated `Box` to hold OS-specific synchronization\n   primitives. The small size of `Mutex` in particular encourages the use\n   of fine-grained locks to increase parallelism.\n2. Uncontended lock acquisition and release is done through fast inline\n   paths which only require a single atomic operation.\n3. Microcontention (a contended lock with a short critical section) is\n   efficiently handled by spinning a few times while trying to acquire a\n   lock.\n4. The locks are adaptive and will suspend a thread after a few failed spin\n   attempts. This makes the locks suitable for both long and short critical\n   sections.\n5. `Condvar`, `RwLock` and `Once` work on Windows XP, unlike the standard\n   library versions of those types.\n6. `RwLock` takes advantage of hardware lock elision on processors that\n   support it, which can lead to huge performance wins with many readers.\n   This must be enabled with the `hardware-lock-elision` feature.\n7. `RwLock` uses a task-fair locking policy, which avoids reader and writer\n   starvation, whereas the standard library version makes no guarantees.\n8. `Condvar` is guaranteed not to produce spurious wakeups. A thread will\n   only be woken up if it timed out or it was woken up by a notification.\n9. `Condvar::notify_all` will only wake up a single thread and requeue the\n   rest to wait on the associated `Mutex`. This avoids a thundering herd\n   problem where all threads try to acquire the lock at the same time.\n10. `RwLock` supports atomically downgrading a write lock into a read lock.\n11. `Mutex` and `RwLock` allow raw unlocking without a RAII guard object.\n12. `Mutex<()>` and `RwLock<()>` allow raw locking without a RAII guard\n    object.\n13. `Mutex` and `RwLock` support [eventual fairness](https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/203350)\n    which allows them to be fair on average without sacrificing performance.\n14. A `ReentrantMutex` type which supports recursive locking.\n15. An *experimental* deadlock detector that works for `Mutex`,\n    `RwLock` and `ReentrantMutex`. This feature is disabled by default and\n    can be enabled via the `deadlock_detection` feature.\n16. `RwLock` supports atomically upgrading an \"upgradable\" read lock into a\n    write lock.\n17. Optional support for [serde](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/). Enable via the\n    feature `serde`. **NOTE!** this support is for `Mutex`, `ReentrantMutex`,\n    and `RwLock` only; `Condvar` and `Once` are not currently supported.\n18. Lock guards can be sent to other threads when the `send_guard` feature is\n    enabled.\n\nThe parking lot\n---------------\n\nTo keep these primitives small, all thread queuing and suspending\nfunctionality is offloaded to the *parking lot*. The idea behind this is\nbased on the Webkit [`WTF::ParkingLot`](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/)\nclass, which essentially consists of a hash table mapping of lock addresses\nto queues of parked (sleeping) threads. The Webkit parking lot was itself\ninspired by Linux [futexes](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/futex.2.html),\nbut it is more powerful since it allows invoking callbacks while holding a queue\nlock.",
            "To enable nightly-only features, add this to your `Cargo.toml` instead:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nparking_lot = { version = \"0.12\", features = [\"nightly\"] }\n```\n\nThe experimental deadlock detector can be enabled with the\n`deadlock_detection` Cargo feature.\n\nTo allow sending `MutexGuard`s and `RwLock*Guard`s to other threads, enable the\n`send_guard` option.\n\nNote that the `deadlock_detection` and `send_guard` features are incompatible\nand cannot be used together.\n\nHardware lock elision support for x86 can be enabled with the\n`hardware-lock-elision` feature. This requires Rust 1.59 due to the use of\ninline assembly.\n\nThe core parking lot API is provided by the `parking_lot_core` crate. It is\nseparate from the synchronization primitives in the `parking_lot` crate so that\nchanges to the core API do not cause breaking changes for users of `parking_lot`."

Several excerpts explicitly discuss the safety implications of unwinding across FFI and the UB that can arise from unsafe code and aliasing rules (Stacked Borrows model). These passages directly ground safety considerations in Rust’s safety model and are therefore most relevant to the requested SAFETY comments. Additional safety-oriented content is provided by discussions of ownership, borrowing, and lifetime safety, which further contextualize why certain patterns are unsafe and how Rust enforces safety. Excerpts that describe safety concepts in passing (e.g., general notes about Send/Sync or memory safety) provide useful context but are less directly about explicit SAFETY comments tied to the field value. The most directly supportive quotes discuss how unwinding across FFI is unsafe or undefined, how stacking borrows defines UB, and how aliasing can lead to unsafe behavior.

Additional excerpts reinforce the channel concept by describing how nightly/beta/stable relate to releases and how toolchains are managed via rustup, including practical examples of using and configuring toolchains.

You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

Additional excerpts reinforce the same idea by describing how union is used in code (for example, stating that *union* is used to declare a union and is a keyword in contexts like unions), which corroborates the primary claim. A reference that enumerates the keywords currently in use across editions further anchors the position of union among active keywords in Rust. Content about reserved keywords for future use and raw identifiers provides broader context about how identifiers interact with keywords, reinforcing why union is treated as a keyword rather than a plain identifier. The most relevant parts are the explicit listing and the usage note about union in union declarations; the surrounding context about keyword families and raw identifiers adds supportive context but is slightly less direct to the specific finegrained field. Overall, the evidence cohesively supports that the field value corresponds to the keyword union in Rust's lexical grammar.",

The registry-oriented excerpts explicitly describe how registries work beyond the default crates.io index, including git and sparse protocols and how an alternate registry is wired into a project. These excerpts together map to the requested field by illustrating both the means to substitute sources (Source Replacement) and the infrastructure (alternate registries and patch/replace mechanics) that makes such substitution possible. The combined evidence demonstrates direct relevance to the field value, including concrete references to source replacement, [patch]/[replace], and alternate registries. Highlighted points include: - explicit mention of Source Replacement and the related Registry concepts, which aligns with the field value. - description of patch and replace sections in manifests as the mechanism to override dependency sources. - explanations of alternate registry protocols and how crates can be resolved against non-default registries. - registry protocols and integration details that underpin how alternate registries are configured and used in Cargo workflows.",

Also,\nbuild dependencies are not available to the package itself unless also\nexplicitly added in the\n[dependencies] table.\nIt is recommended to carefully consider each dependency you add, weighing\nagainst the impact on compile time, licensing, maintenance, etc. Cargo will\nattempt to reuse a dependency if it is shared between build dependencies and\nnormal dependencies. However, this is not always possible, for example when\ncross-compiling, so keep that in consideration of the impact on compile time.",
            "*-sys Packages\nSome Cargo packages that link to system libraries have a naming convention of\nhaving a\n-sys suffix. Any package named\nfoo-sys should provide two major\npieces of functionality:\n    * The library crate should link to the native library\nlibfoo . This will often\nprobe the current system for\nlibfoo before resorting to building from\nsource.\n    * The library crate should provide declarations for types and functions in\nlibfoo , but not higher-level abstractions.\n\nThe set of\n*-sys packages provides a common set of dependencies for linking\nto native libraries. There are a number of benefits earned from having this\nconvention of native-library-related packages:\n    * Common dependencies on\nfoo-sys alleviates the rule about one package per\nvalue of\nlinks .\n    * Other\n-sys packages can take advantage of the\nDEP_NAME_KEY=value environment variables to better integrate with other packages. See the “Using another\nsys crate” example.\n    * A common dependency allows centralizing logic on discovering\nlibfoo itself\n(or building it from source).\n    * These dependencies are easily overridable .\n\nIt is common to have a companion package without the\n-sys suffix that\nprovides a safe, high-level abstractions on top of the sys package. For\nexample, the\ngit2 crate provides a high-level interface to the\nlibgit2-sys crate .\nOverriding Build Scripts\nIf a manifest contains a\nlinks key, then Cargo supports overriding the build\nscript specified with a custom library. The purpose of this functionality is to\nprevent running the build script in question altogether and instead supply the\nmetadata ahead of time.\nTo override a build script, place the following configuration in any acceptable\nconfig.toml file.\n[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.foo]\nrustc-link-lib = [\"foo\"]\nrustc-link-search = [\"/path/to/foo\"]\nrustc-flags = \"-L /some/path\"\nrustc-cfg = ['key=\"value\"']\nrustc-env = {key = \"value\"}\nrustc-cdylib-link-arg = [\"…\"]\nmetadata_key1 = \"value\"\nmetadata_key2 = \"value\"\nWith this configuration, if a package declares that it links to\nfoo then the\nbuild script will not be compiled or run, and the metadata specified will\nbe used instead.\nThe\nwarning ,\nrerun-if-changed , and\nrerun-if-env-changed keys should not\nbe used and will be ignored.\nJobserver\nCargo and\nrustc use the jobserver protocol , developed for GNU make, to\ncoordinate concurrency across processes. It is essentially a semaphore that\ncontrols the number of jobs running concurrently. The concurrency may be set\nwith the\n--jobs flag, which defaults to the number of logical CPUs.\nEach build script inherits one job slot from Cargo, and should endeavor to\nonly use one CPU while it runs. If the script wants to use more CPUs in\nparallel, it should use the\njobserver crate to coordinate with Cargo.\nAs an example, the\ncc crate may enable the optional\nparallel feature\nwhich will use the jobserver protocol to attempt to build multiple C files\nat the same time"

It notes that dependencies and build scripts must be weighed for their impact on compile time, especially in scenarios like cross-compiling where certain dependencies may not be readily available or may behave differently. This directly aligns with the concept of cross-compilation as it affects how crates are built when targeting different platforms or architectures. A second excerpt appears to touch on the broader build-system and target-related behavior in the Cargo ecosystem (build scripts, environment interactions, and target-specific considerations). While it may not spell out the term immediately, it provides contextual grounding on how Cargo handles builds across multiple targets and how build scripts interact with different compilation environments, which is inherently related to cross-compilation practices in Rust projects. Taken together, these excerpts support the idea that cross-compilation concerns influence dependency management, build script execution, and overall build behavior in the Rust toolchain.",

You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

This demonstrates the exact mechanism by which static linkage is achieved in a Rust/Cargo workflow. Other excerpts discuss the static option as a valid kind in the library-linking spec, including the possibility to specify KIND as one of dylib, static, framework, etc., which directly aligns with Static linking concepts and the MUSL/CRT context when choosing a static libc or static CRT linkage. Additional excerpts explain how the Cargo manifest can declare a native library to be linked, and how rustc-link-lib can be used to link libraries, which are all essential pathways to configure static linking in Rust projects. The surrounding content about how to specify libraries in build scripts, and how link-search paths and environment interactions work, support the broader context of static linking in real-world builds, including when MUSL or CRT might come into play.

Additional excerpts discuss Rocket as an async web framework with specific focus areas like usability, security, extensibility, and speed, which reinforces the same category. Overviews that mention multiple frameworks together and describe what “mature” or “production-ready” frameworks offer (routing, middleware, templating, JSON/form handling) further corroborate the category by illustrating the scope and capabilities typical of web frameworks. References to documentation, quickstarts, getting started guides, and guides that organize the material around framework usage all support the classification of these items as web frameworks. Even broader comparative or ecosystem-level statements about Rust web frameworks (Are we web yet? summarizing frameworks such as Actix Web, Axum, Warp, Tide, and library ecosystems with databases and integrations) reinforce that the core topic is about web frameworks in Rust. Later excerpts that discuss performance benchmarks compare frameworks (Actix vs others) but still stay within the domain of web frameworks, thus remaining relevant to the same fine-grained field value. In sum, the most relevant content consists of direct framework descriptions, ecosystem overviews, and documentation-oriented material that centers on Rust web frameworks and their capabilities. The less direct but supportive material includes performance comparisons and ecosystem references, which contextualize the framework category without changing its fundamental nature as web frameworks.",

As such, they cannot be used as identifiers (except\nas raw identifiers as we’ll discuss in the “ [Raw\nIdentifiers]() ” section). Identifiers are names\nof functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants,\nmacros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes. ### [Keywords Currently in Use]()\n\nThe following is a list of keywords currently in use, with their functionality\ndescribed.\n* `as` \\- perform primitive casting, disambiguate the specific trait containing\n  an item, or rename items in `use` statements\n* `async` \\- return a `Future` instead of blocking the current thread\n* `await` \\- suspend execution until the result of a `Future` is ready\n* `break` \\- exit a loop immediately\n* `const` \\- define constant items or constant raw pointers\n* `continue` \\- continue to the next loop iteration\n* `crate` \\- in a module path, refers to the crate root\n* `dyn` \\- dynamic dispatch to a trait object\n* `else` \\- fallback for `if` and `if let` control flow constructs\n* `enum` \\- define an enumeration\n* `extern` \\- link an external function or variable\n* `false` \\- Boolean false literal\n* `fn` \\- define a function or the function pointer type\n* `for` \\- loop over items from an iterator, implement a trait, or specify a\n  higher-ranked lifetime\n* `if` \\- branch based on the result of a conditional expression\n* `impl` \\- implement inherent or trait functionality\n* `in` \\- part of `for` loop syntax\n* `let` \\- bind a variable\n* `loop` \\- loop unconditionally\n* `match` \\- match a value to patterns\n* `mod` \\- define a module\n* `move` \\- make a closure take ownership of all its captures\n* `mut` \\- denote mutability in references, raw pointers, or pattern bindings\n* `pub` \\- denote public visibility in struct fields, `impl` blocks, or modules\n* `ref` \\- bind by reference\n* `return` \\- return from function\n* `Self` \\- a type alias for the type we are defining or\nimplementing\n* `self` \\- method subject or current module\n* `static` \\- global variable or lifetime lasting the entire program execution\n* `struct` \\- define a structure\n* `super` \\- parent module of the current module\n* `trait` \\- define a trait\n* `true` \\- Boolean true literal\n* `type` \\- define a type alias or associated type\n* `union` \\- define a [union](../reference/items/unions.html) ; is only a keyword when used\n  in a union declaration\n* `unsafe` \\- denote unsafe code, functions, traits, or implementations\n* `use` \\- bring symbols into scope; specify precise captures for generic and\n  lifetime bounds\n* `where` \\- denote clauses that constrain a type\n* `while` \\- loop conditionally based on the result of an expression\n\n### [Keywords Reserved for Future Use]()\n\nThe following keywords do not yet have any functionality but are reserved by\nRust for potential future use. * `abstract`\n* `become`\n* `box`\n* `do`\n* `final`\n* `gen`\n* `macro`\n* `override`\n* `priv`\n* `try`\n* `typeof`\n* `unsized`\n* `virtual`\n* `yield`\n\n### [Raw Identifiers]()\n\n_Raw identifiers_ are the syntax that lets you use keywords where they wouldn’t\nnormally be allowed. You use a raw identifier by prefixing a keyword with `r#` . For example, `match` is a keyword. If you try to compile the following function\nthat uses `match` as its name:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n! [Image](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg \"This code does not compile!\")\nfn match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n```\n\nyou’ll get this error:\n\n```\nerror: expected identifier, found keyword \\`match\\`\n --> src/main.rs:4:4\n  |\n4 | fn match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {\n  |    ^^^^^ expected identifier, found keyword\n```\n\nThe error shows that you can’t use the keyword `match` as the function\nidentifier. To use `match` as a function name, you need to use the raw\nidentifier syntax, like this:\n\nFilename: src/main.rs\n\n```\n```\nfn r # match (needle: & str , haystack: & str ) -> bool {\n    haystack.contains(needle)\n}\n\nfn main () {\n    assert! (r# match ( \"foo\" , \"foobar\" ));\n}\n```\n```\n\nThis code will compile without any errors. Note the `r#` prefix on the function\nname in its definition as well as where the function is called in `main` . Raw identifiers allow you to use any word you choose as an identifier, even if\nthat word happens to be a reserved keyword. This gives us more freedom to choose\nidentifier names, as well as lets us integrate with programs written in a\nlanguage where these words aren’t keywords. In addition, raw identifiers allow\nyou to use libraries written in a different Rust edition than your crate uses. For example, `try` isn’t a keyword in the 2015 edition but is in the 2018, 2021,\nand 2024 editions.\nIf you depend on a library that is written using the 2015\nedition and has a `try` function, you’ll need to use the raw identifier syntax, `r` in this case, to call that function from your code on later editions.

            "*-sys Packages\nSome Cargo packages that link to system libraries have a naming convention of\nhaving a\n-sys suffix. Any package named\nfoo-sys should provide two major\npieces of functionality:\n    * The library crate should link to the native library\nlibfoo . This will often\nprobe the current system for\nlibfoo before resorting to building from\nsource.\n    * The library crate should provide declarations for types and functions in\nlibfoo , but not higher-level abstractions.\n\nThe set of\n*-sys packages provides a common set of dependencies for linking\nto native libraries. There are a number of benefits earned from having this\nconvention of native-library-related packages:\n    * Common dependencies on\nfoo-sys alleviates the rule about one package per\nvalue of\nlinks .\n    * Other\n-sys packages can take advantage of the\nDEP_NAME_KEY=value environment variables to better integrate with other packages. See the “Using another\nsys crate” example.\n    * A common dependency allows centralizing logic on discovering\nlibfoo itself\n(or building it from source).\n    * These dependencies are easily overridable .\n\nIt is common to have a companion package without the\n-sys suffix that\nprovides a safe, high-level abstractions on top of the sys package. For\nexample, the\ngit2 crate provides a high-level interface to the\nlibgit2-sys crate .\nOverriding Build Scripts\nIf a manifest contains a\nlinks key, then Cargo supports overriding the build\nscript specified with a custom library. The purpose of this functionality is to\nprevent running the build script in question altogether and instead supply the\nmetadata ahead of time.\nTo override a build script, place the following configuration in any acceptable\nconfig.toml file.\n[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.foo]\nrustc-link-lib = [\"foo\"]\nrustc-link-search = [\"/path/to/foo\"]\nrustc-flags = \"-L /some/path\"\nrustc-cfg = ['key=\"value\"']\nrustc-env = {key = \"value\"}\nrustc-cdylib-link-arg = [\"…\"]\nmetadata_key1 = \"value\"\nmetadata_key2 = \"value\"\nWith this configuration, if a package declares that it links to\nfoo then the\nbuild script will not be compiled or run, and the metadata specified will\nbe used instead.\nThe\nwarning ,\nrerun-if-changed , and\nrerun-if-env-changed keys should not\nbe used and will be ignored.\nJobserver\nCargo and\nrustc use the jobserver protocol , developed for GNU make, to\ncoordinate concurrency across processes. It is essentially a semaphore that\ncontrols the number of jobs running concurrently. The concurrency may be set\nwith the\n--jobs flag, which defaults to the number of logical CPUs.\nEach build script inherits one job slot from Cargo, and should endeavor to\nonly use one CPU while it runs. If the script wants to use more CPUs in\nparallel, it should use the\njobserver crate to coordinate with Cargo.\nAs an example, the\ncc crate may enable the optional\nparallel feature\nwhich will use the jobserver protocol to attempt to build multiple C files\nat the same time"

      "reasoning": "MSRV stands for the minimum Rust version required to use certain Cargo features or build scripts. The most direct support for this concept comes from an excerpt that explicitly uses the MSRV label and ties it to a specific version, indicating the version at which a change or requirement is observed (for example, stating that a particular MSRV is respected as of a given Rust toolchain version). Additional excerpts provide concrete version numbers associated with MSRV, noting that certain syntax or directives are only supported starting from a particular Rust/Cargo version (and recommending alternative syntax for older versions). Together, these excerpts establish that MSRV is a version-bound concept, used to communicate compatibility constraints and recommended practices for older toolchains, with exact version numbers occasionally cited (e.g., 1.77 and 1.80) as milestones or thresholds. The presence of these explicit version references confirms that MSRV is a documented guardrail in tooling behavior and guides users on compatibility expectations across versions.",

From the excerpts, the closest support comes from the discussion of traits: traits enable defining shared behavior abstractly, and trait bounds express that a generic type must have certain behavior. This directly touches on the core idea of defining a trait that represents capability or contract. The excerpts about visibility and privacy shed light on how visibility (pub, pub(crate), pub(in path), etc.) can be used to restrict or expose parts of an API, which is a key mechanism in implementing a sealed-like pattern (you often declare the implementing type to be in a private module or hide the implementor behind a private trait). Specific statements include: using traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way and using trait bounds to constrain types, which aligns with the motivation for a sealed trait approach; and discussions of how visibility controls item access and exposure, which is relevant to restricting implementations. The remaining excerpts elaborate on visibility rules, examples, and edition changes, which are tangential to the concept but provide necessary context about Rust’s access control and module system that would be used when designing or understanding a sealed-like pattern. However, none of the excerpts explicitly describe the Sealed Trait Pattern itself, its canonical implementation technique, or its practical code example. Therefore, the strongest support comes from the trait-focused content, while the rest provide contextual backdrop on visibility and module privacy that relates indirectly to sealing implementations.",

The subsequent excerpt emphasizes that a mutex is a mutual exclusion primitive that blocks threads waiting for the lock to become available, reinforcing why holding a guard across an await could block progress and lead to deadlocks in async scenarios. The discussion of poisoning—where a thread panic can poison the mutex—adds a cautionary note about error states while holding a lock, which is tangentially relevant to robust lock handling in async contexts. Additional excerpts provide foundational understanding: the general notion that mutexes protect shared data, the use of Arc to enable sharing across threads, and example code that shows common patterns of creating and acquiring a lock. Taken together, these excerpts support the idea that using a guard across an await is an anti-pattern by illustrating the typical lock usage patterns and the potential pitfalls (blocking, panic poisoning) without contradicting them.

            "Rust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)\n\nAn enum is said to be _field-less_ if none of its variants have associated data. By default, composite structures have an alignment equal to the maximum\nof their fields' alignments. Rust will consequently insert padding where\nnecessary to ensure that all fields are properly aligned and that the overall\ntype's size is a multiple of its alignment. For instance:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nwill be 32-bit aligned on a target that aligns these primitives to their\nrespective sizes. The whole struct will therefore have a size that is a multiple\nof 32-bits. It may become:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: u8,\n    _pad1: [u8; 3], // to align \\`b\\`\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    _pad2: [u8; 2], // to make overall size multiple of 4\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nor maybe:\n\n```\n```rust\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    b: u32,\n    c: u16,\n    a: u8,\n    _pad: u8,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nThere is _no indirection_ for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```rust\n#!",
            "First and foremost, all types have an alignment specified in bytes. The\nalignment of a type specifies what addresses are valid to store the value at. A\nvalue with alignment `n` must only be stored at an address that is a multiple of\n`n`. So alignment 2 means you must be stored at an even address, and 1 means\nthat you can be stored anywhere. Alignment is at least 1, and always a power\nof 2. Primitives are usually aligned to their size, although this is\nplatform-specific behavior. For example, on x86 `u64` and `f64` are often\naligned to 4 bytes (32 bits). A type's size must always be a multiple of its alignment (Zero being a valid size\nfor any alignment). This ensures that an array of that type may always be indexed\nby offsetting by a multiple of its size. Note that the size and alignment of a\ntype may not be known statically in the case of [dynamically sized types](exotic-sizes.html).\nRust gives you the following ways to lay out composite data:\n\n* structs (named product types)\n* tuples (anonymous product types)\n* arrays (homogeneous product types)\n* enums (named sum types -- tagged unions)\n* unions (untagged unions)",
            "\n\nThere is *no indirection* for these types; all data is stored within the struct,\nas you would expect in C. However with the exception of arrays (which are\ndensely packed and in-order), the layout of data is not specified by default. Given the two following struct definitions:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct A {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n\nstruct B {\n    a: i32,\n    b: u64,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nRust *does* guarantee that two instances of A have their data laid out in\nexactly the same way. However Rust *does not* currently guarantee that an\ninstance of A has the same field ordering or padding as an instance of B. With A and B as written, this point would seem to be pedantic, but several other\nfeatures of Rust make it desirable for the language to play with data layout in\ncomplex ways. For instance, consider this struct:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct Foo<T, U> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: T,\n    data2: U,\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nNow consider the monomorphizations of `Foo<u32, u16>` and `Foo<u16, u32>`. If\nRust lays out the fields in the order specified, we expect it to pad the\nvalues in the struct to satisfy their alignment requirements. So if Rust\ndidn't reorder fields, we would expect it to produce the following:\n\n```\nstruct Foo<u16, u32> {\n    count: u16,\n    data1: u16,\n    data2: u32,\n}\n\nstruct Foo<u32, u16> {\n    count: u16,\n    _pad1: u16,\n    data1: u32,\n    data2: u16,\n    _pad2: u16,\n}\n```\n\nThe latter case quite simply wastes space. An optimal use of space\nrequires different monomorphizations to have *different field orderings*. Enums make this consideration even more complicated. Naively, an enum such as:\n\n```\n```\n#! [allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nenum Foo {\n    A(u32),\n    B(u64),\n    C(u8),\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nmight be laid out as:\n\n```\n```\n#!\n[allow(unused)]\nfn main() {\nstruct FooRepr {\n    data: u64, // this is either a u64, u32, or u8 based on `tag`\n    tag: u8,   // 0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C\n}\n}\n```\n```\n\nAnd indeed this is approximately how it would be laid out (modulo the\nsize and position of `tag`). However there are several cases where such a representation is inefficient. The\nclassic case of this is Rust's \"null pointer optimization\": an enum consisting\nof a single outer unit variant (e.g. `None`) and a (potentially nested) non-\nnullable pointer variant (e.g. `Some(&T)`) makes the tag unnecessary. A null\npointer can safely be interpreted as the unit (`None`) variant. The net\nresult is that, for example, `size_of::<Option<&T>>() == size_of::<&T>()`. There are many types in Rust that are, or contain, non-nullable pointers such as\n`Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, `String`, `&T`, and `&mut T`. Similarly, one can imagine\nnested enums pooling their tags into a single discriminant, as they are by\ndefinition known to have a limited range of valid values. In principle enums could\nuse fairly elaborate algorithms to store bits throughout nested types with\nforbidden values. As such it is *especially* desirable that\nwe leave enum layout unspecified today."
