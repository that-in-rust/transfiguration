# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating an open source AI-powered IDE inspired by our analysis of Kiro, but built from the ground up with Claude-style API endpoints for AI integration. The primary users are **developers** who want a modern, AI-enhanced coding environment without vendor lock-in or proprietary restrictions.

**MVP Goal:** Create a VS Code-based IDE with integrated Claude AI assistance that provides intelligent code suggestions, multi-file editing capabilities, and seamless AI-powered development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an AI-powered IDE that integrates with Claude API endpoints, so that I can get intelligent code assistance without being locked into proprietary platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the IDE THEN the system SHALL provide a VS Code-based interface with AI integration
2. WHEN I configure Claude API credentials THEN the system SHALL securely store and use them for AI requests
3. WHEN I request AI assistance THEN the system SHALL send requests to Claude API endpoints
4. WHEN AI responses are received THEN the system SHALL display them in an intuitive interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent code suggestions and completions, so that I can write code more efficiently with AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type code THEN the system SHALL provide contextual AI-powered suggestions
2. WHEN I request code completion THEN the system SHALL use Claude API to generate relevant completions
3. WHEN I accept suggestions THEN the system SHALL integrate them seamlessly into my code
4. WHEN suggestions are inappropriate THEN the system SHALL allow easy rejection and learning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered multi-file editing capabilities, so that I can make coordinated changes across my entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I describe a change request THEN the system SHALL analyze multiple files for necessary modifications
2. WHEN multi-file changes are proposed THEN the system SHALL show a clear diff preview
3. WHEN I approve changes THEN the system SHALL apply modifications across all affected files
4. WHEN changes conflict THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution assistance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want conversational AI assistance for debugging and problem-solving, so that I can get help with complex coding challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encounter errors THEN the system SHALL offer AI-powered debugging assistance
2. WHEN I ask questions about code THEN the system SHALL provide contextual explanations
3. WHEN I request refactoring suggestions THEN the system SHALL analyze code and propose improvements
4. WHEN I need documentation THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate comments and docs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure and configurable AI integration, so that I can control how my code and data are shared with AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure AI settings THEN the system SHALL provide granular privacy controls
2. WHEN sending code to AI THEN the system SHALL respect configured privacy boundaries
3. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL use secure encryption
4. WHEN offline mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL function without AI features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensible AI capabilities, so that I can customize and extend the AI integration for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install AI extensions THEN the system SHALL support custom AI providers
2. WHEN I configure custom prompts THEN the system SHALL use them for AI interactions
3. WHEN I create AI workflows THEN the system SHALL allow automation of common tasks
4. WHEN I share configurations THEN the system SHALL support team-wide AI settings
