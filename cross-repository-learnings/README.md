# Cross-Repository Learnings

Distilled wisdom, patterns, and anti-patterns extracted from work across all projects.

## What's Here

This section contains the **synthesized knowledge**—the patterns we've discovered that work consistently, the mistakes we've made and shouldn't repeat, and the frameworks we use to make decisions.

## Current Sections

### tdd-and-architecture-principles
Test-Driven Development practices and architectural decision-making principles.

**Contents:**
- TDD in Rust and layered architectures
- When to write tests first vs. exploratory coding
- Architecture principles for maintainable systems
- Code conventions and standards

**Value:** Established patterns that have proven successful across multiple projects

## How This Section Grows

As we work on projects, we extract learnings and add them here:

### Successful Patterns (to be added)
Document patterns that:
- Worked well across multiple projects
- Solved recurring problems elegantly
- Made code more maintainable
- Improved development velocity

### Anti-Patterns and Failures (to be added)
Document approaches that:
- Seemed good but caused problems later
- Led to technical debt
- Made code harder to maintain
- Wasted time on premature optimization

### Decision Frameworks (to be added)
Document how we make key decisions:
- Technology selection criteria
- When to stop optimizing
- When to refactor vs. rewrite
- How to evaluate trade-offs

## How to Use

**Before making a major decision:**
1. Check if we've faced similar decisions before
2. Review what worked and what didn't
3. Apply the relevant framework
4. Document your own decision for future reference

**After completing a project phase:**
1. Extract patterns that emerged
2. Document what you'd do differently
3. Add to this section for future benefit

## Philosophy

Every mistake is valuable if we learn from it. Every success is replicable if we document it. This section is our institutional memory distilled into actionable wisdom.
