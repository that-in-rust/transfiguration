## How to Use

When starting research:
1. Check if similar research already exists here
2. Build on previous findings rather than starting from scratch
3. Add new research to appropriate folder or create new domain-specific folder
4. Use 3+ word folder names that describe the content

When completing research:
1. Write a summary document with key findings
2. Include what worked, what didn't, and recommendations
3. Link to related research in other sections
