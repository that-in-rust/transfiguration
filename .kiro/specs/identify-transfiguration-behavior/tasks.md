## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy per Task
- **Unit Testing**: Each analysis function tested with sample inputs and expected outputs
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline testing with complete Kiro extraction
- **Validation Testing**: Cross-reference validation between analysis components
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure analysis consistency across multiple runs

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: All analysis functions must have test coverage
- **Documentation Coverage**: All extracted behaviors must be documented with confidence levels
- **Validation Coverage**: All analysis results must pass cross-validation checks
- **Completeness Coverage**: All requirements must be addressed by analysis outputs

### Success Criteria
- **Behavioral Specification Completeness**: All discoverable Kiro behaviors documented
- **API Compatibility Matrix**: Complete extension API surface mapped for compatibility
- **UI/UX Pattern Library**: All visual components and styling documented for replication
- **Phase 2 Readiness**: Architecture design phase can proceed with complete behavioral specification

## Implementation Notes

### Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Bash scripting for file processing and analysis orchestration
- **JSON Processing**: jq for JSON parsing, manipulation, and validation
- **Text Processing**: grep, sed, awk for pattern matching and text extraction
- **File Operations**: find, xargs for efficient file system operations
- **Documentation**: Markdown generation with structured JSON data embedding

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (primary), with Linux compatibility
- **Dependencies**: jq, grep, find, sed, awk (standard Unix tools)
- **Input**: Extracted Kiro files at `/Users/neetipatni/Desktop/extracted_kiro`
- **Output**: Structured analysis results in designated output directory

### Performance Considerations
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent analysis components run concurrently
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream processing for large files to minimize memory usage
- **Incremental Analysis**: Support for partial re-analysis of changed files only
- **Caching**: Intermediate results cached to avoid redundant processing

This implementation plan provides a systematic, test-driven approach to extracting all discoverable behavioral information from the static Kiro files, creating the comprehensive specification needed for successful Rust/WASM transfiguration planning in Phase 2.
