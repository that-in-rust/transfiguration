# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Rust command-line tool that can unpack a specific .deb file (Kiro202509172055-distro-linux-x64.deb) to its maximum depth, allowing developers to analyze and decipher the underlying package structure and code. The tool should handle the .deb format and any nested archives within to provide complete visibility into the package contents.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to unpack the Kiro202509172055-distro-linux-x64.deb file to its maximum depth, so that I can analyze all nested package contents and underlying code structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is run on the .deb file THEN the system SHALL extract the outer .deb package structure
2. WHEN the .deb contains control.tar and data.tar archives THEN the system SHALL extract both archives
3. WHEN nested archives are found within the extracted contents THEN the system SHALL continue unpacking recursively
4. WHEN extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all extracted files and directories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to handle .deb package format and common archive formats found within, so that I can fully extract the Kiro package contents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the input file is a .deb package THEN the system SHALL extract the debian-binary, control.tar, and data.tar components
2. WHEN TAR archives are encountered THEN the system SHALL extract their contents
3. WHEN GZIP compressed files are found THEN the system SHALL decompress them
4. WHEN XZ compressed files are found THEN the system SHALL decompress them
5. WHEN nested archives are discovered THEN the system SHALL recursively extract them
6. WHEN an unsupported format is encountered THEN the system SHALL log a warning and continue processing other files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify an output directory for extracted files, so that I can organize the unpacked contents in a location of my choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies an output directory THEN the system SHALL create the directory if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN no output directory is specified THEN the system SHALL create a default directory based on the input filename
3. WHEN the output directory already contains files THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before overwriting
4. WHEN extraction conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle filename collisions gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed logging and progress information, so that I can monitor the unpacking process and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unpacking begins THEN the system SHALL display the current file being processed
2. WHEN each archive is extracted THEN the system SHALL log the number of files extracted
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with context
4. WHEN unpacking is complete THEN the system SHALL display a final summary with total files processed
5. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show detailed information about each operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to handle edge cases and security concerns, so that I can safely unpack files without system compromise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN archive contains paths with directory traversal attempts THEN the system SHALL sanitize paths and prevent extraction outside the target directory
2. WHEN archive contains extremely large files THEN the system SHALL implement size limits and warn the user
3. WHEN archive contains too many nested levels THEN the system SHALL implement depth limits to prevent infinite recursion
4. WHEN archive is corrupted or malformed THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue with other files
5. WHEN extraction would exceed available disk space THEN the system SHALL warn the user and allow cancellation
