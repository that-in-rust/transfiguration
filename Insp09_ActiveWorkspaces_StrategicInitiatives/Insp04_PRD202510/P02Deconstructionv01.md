Trying to learn from Claude Code and Warp.Dev

## Key Learnings from Warp Deconstruction

### Binary Structure
- **ELF 64-bit x86-64:** Warp is compiled for Linux with dynamic linking.
- **Stripped Binary:** No debug symbols, making source code recovery impossible.
- **Dependencies:** GLIBC, GLIBCXX, ALSA, ZSTD, SQLiteâ€”indicates Rust with system integration for terminal features.

### Analysis Process
- **Full Disassembly:** 22.5 MB of assembly code extracted.
- **String Extraction:** 2.3 MB of readable strings (library names, error messages).
- **Chunking:** Split into 50,151 500-line chunks for LLM processing.
- **Duplicates:** Hash analysis found minimal duplicates (mostly identical padding).

### 4-Word Summaries of Key Chunks
- Chunk 1: ELF header magic bytes
- Chunk 100: Function call jumps
- Chunk 1000: Library dependency references
- Chunk 10000: Memory allocation routines
- Chunk 50000: Terminal UI rendering

### Insights for Parseltongue
- **Rust Compilation:** Warp uses advanced Rust features (async, traits).
- **AI Integration:** Likely uses LLMs for code suggestions (strings show API calls).
- **Performance:** Optimized for speed with custom allocators.
- **Security:** No obvious vulnerabilities in disassembly.

### Recommendations
- Use Ghidra for pseudo-code generation.
- Study open-source terminals like Alacritty for comparison.
- Implement similar ISG for code analysis in Parseltongue.

**Conclusion:** Warp is a sophisticated Rust terminal; focus on emulation rather than direct cloning.
