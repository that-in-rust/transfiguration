# P25 Tool Collection — Individual Tools Catalog

Conventions Reliability
- Naming: three-word-kebab-case.
- IO: JSON over stdin/stdout; files by path; deterministic where possible.
- Boundaries: codegraph-write-surface is the only writer; all other tools are read-only analysis.
- LLM usage: rule-first, LLM-late; ≤3K tokens; offline-capable where feasible.

> **Reliability-First Summary**: Conventions enforce deterministic validation through rust-analyzer overlays and cargo check gates. Tools implement bounded concurrency (Tokio runtime) with cooperative yields for UI responsiveness. Caching strategies (ISG + HNSW persisted) ensure sub-100ms query performance. Error recovery uses thiserror patterns with complete diagnostic surfaces. Memory pressure managed via quantization (Q4_K_M) and dynamic parallelism throttling.

## Production-Ready LLM Prompt Engineering (P34 Raycast AI Integration)

### **System Prompt Architecture for Parseltongue-R1**

**Core Agent Contract**:
- **Role**: Parseltongue-R1, a Rust bug-fixing agent operating over an Interface Signature Graph (ISG) in CozoDB
- **Objective**: Produce minimal, validated diffs that fix failing tests/builds without degrading style or semantics
- **Tools**: cozo.query(), cargo.run(), fs.read(), patch.apply() with deterministic interfaces
- **Hard Constraints**: ≤2 files, ≤30 changed lines, ISG blast radius ≤2 hops, structured surgical edits only

**Input/Output Schema Specification**:
```json
{
  "bug_report": {
    "symptom": "string",
    "stderr_snippet": "string",
    "failing_test_names": ["string"],
    "seed_uids": ["string"]
  },
  "limits": {
    "time_budget_sec": 60,
    "max_files_changed": 2,
    "max_lines_changed": 30
  }
}
```

**Required Output Contracts**:
- **micro_prd**: Concise problem statement with interfaces to modify and success criteria
- **context_pack**: Compressed facts with blast radius, type constraints, and risk flags
- **transformation_plan**: Graph-first modifications with feasibility checks
- **validation_plan**: Selective tests and validation guards
- **confidence_report**: Calibrated probability with coverage/agreement/consistency metrics
- **patch**: Unified diff only when gate = proceed

### **Deterministic Workflow Engineering**

**6-Step Validation Pipeline**:
1. **Retrieve Symbols**: Exact 2-hop neighborhood via CALLS/DEPENDS edges
2. **Compress to ContextPack**: Type/borrow constraints with ≤3 candidate edit sites
3. **Plan Edit**: 1-2 transformations preferring signature/bound changes
4. **Confidence Estimate**: Calibrated p(pass) with mathematical formula
5. **Generate Patch**: Unified diff within budget touching only approved UIDs
6. **Emit Outputs**: JSON + unified diff with ≤5 bullet rationale

**Confidence Gating Formula**:
```
p = σ(w₀ + w₁·coverage + w₂·agreement + w₃·consistency + w₄·static_precheck)
```
- If p < 0.70: ask targeted questions or widen retrieval once
- Run validation in order: fmt_check → check → test_selective → test_full
- Abort on new warnings promoted to deny

### **Query Snippets for Deterministic Operations**

**Blast Radius Calculation**:
```datalog
blast(uid, hop) := start[uid], hop = 0
blast(uid, hop) := blast(prev, h), h < 2,
  *interface_relationships{from_uid: prev, to_uid: uid, edge_type: 'CALLS'|'DEPENDS'},
  hop = h + 1
```

**Pattern Matching via Vector Similarity**:
```datalog
?[pattern_id, name, distance] :=
  ~pattern_library:pattern_vec_idx{
    pattern_id, name | query: vec_embed($stderr), k: 5, bind_distance: distance
  }
```

**Code and Metadata Retrieval**:
```datalog
?[uid, code, signature] :=
  blast(uid, _),
  *interface_code{uid, current_code: code},
  *interface_metadata{uid, signature}
```

### **Production-Ready Example Transformation**

**Input**: Async spawn Send bound error
**Output**:
```json

  "micro_prd": {
    "title": "Add Send bound to spawn generic",
    "problem_statement": "Future cannot be sent between threads safely",

    "interfaces_to_modify": ["src/runtime.rs-runtime-spawn"]
  },
  "transformation_plan": [{
    "uid": "src/runtime.rs-runtime-spawn",
    "action": "MODIFY",
    "signature_old": "pub fn spawn<F: Future>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<F::Output>",
    "signature_new": "pub fn spawn<F: Future + Send + 'static>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<F::Output>",
    "constraints_added": ["Send", "'static"]
  }],
  "confidence_report": {
    "coverage": 0.82, "agreement": 0.78, "consistency": 0.85,
    "static_precheck": 0.76, "p_pass": 0.88, "gate": "proceed"
  },
  "patch": "--- a/src/runtime.rs\n+++ b/src/runtime.rs\n@@\n-pub fn spawn<F: Future>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<F::Output> {\n+pub fn spawn<F: Future + Send + 'static>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<F::Output> {\n"
}
```

### **Prompt Hygiene and Validation Rules**

**Remove**: Marketing claims, emojis, repeated blocks, unverifiable metrics, vague goals
**Add**: Agent role definition, tool interfaces, input/output schemas, deterministic workflows
**Constrain**: Patch minimality, edit surfaces, time/token budgets, retry/escalation rules
**Validate**: Confidence thresholds, test impact selection, clippy/rustdoc guards

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Single source of truth for schemas
- Deterministic order of operations
- Hard stop criteria and validation gates
- No speculative code outside blast radius
- Calibrated confidence with mathematical thresholds

3. **Selective Testing**: Targeted test execution based on ISG blast radius
4. **Style Validation**: cargo fmt + clippy with deny warnings
5. **Documentation**: rustdoc validation when enabled

**Confidence Calibration Framework**:
- **Coverage**: Completeness of ISG blast radius analysis
- **Agreement**: Consistency between pattern matching and graph traversal
- **Consistency**: Internal coherence of transformation plan
- **Static Precheck**: Deterministic validation via rust-analyzer

**Validation Gate Decision Matrix**:
| Confidence | Action | Validation Required |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| p ≥ 0.85 | Proceed | Full validation pipeline |
| 0.70 ≤ p < 0.85 | Proceed | Enhanced validation + fallback tests |
| p < 0.70 | Hold | Expand retrieval or ask clarifying questions |

### **Error Recovery and Rollback Strategy**

**Automatic Rollback Triggers**:
- New warnings promoted to deny
- Test failures in previously passing suite
- Compilation errors after patch application
- Performance regression beyond thresholds

**Recovery Procedures**:
1. **Git Revert**: Automatic rollback to previous commit
2. **ISG Restoration**: Revert interface_code to previous state
3. **Pattern Learning**: Log failure for pattern effectiveness tracking
4. **User Notification**: Clear explanation of rollback reason

**Audit Trail Requirements**:
- Complete transformation history with timestamps
- Confidence scores and validation results
- Pattern effectiveness metrics per repository
- User feedback incorporation for learning

## Shreyas Doshi Minimalist Product Architecture (P34 Deep Analysis)

### **The One-Line Job Story**

**"When I hit a Rust bug, get me to a validated, minimal patch in under 90 seconds."**

### **Highest-ROI, Lowest-Risk Functional Changes**

| Priority | Change | ROI Impact | Effort | Risk | Implementation Time |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|------|-------------------|
| **1** | **Caching Basics** (sccache + persistent RA + memoized Cozo) | **5-10x validation speed** | Low | Low | 1-2 days |
| **2** | **Deterministic 2-Hop Retrieval** (CALLS/DEPENDS with node cap) | **4-10x context compression** | Low | Low | 2-3 days |
| **3** | **ContextPack v0** (seeds, candidates, type/bound hints) | **3-8x reasoning quality** | Low | Low | 1-2 days |
| **4** | **Pattern DB v0** (3 high-yield fixes) | **70% bug coverage** | Low | Low | 2-3 days |
| **5** | **Signature-Only Edits** with hard limits | **95% first-try success** | Low | Low | 1 day |
| **6** | **Short-Circuit Validation** (fmt → check → failing tests) | **Fast feedback loop** | Low | Low | 1 day |
| **7** | **Rule-Based Confidence Gate** (trigger + feasibility) | **Zero bad compiles** | Low | Low | 1 day |
| **8** | **Stable Structural UIDs** (module_path::item_kind::name) | **Prevents reference drift** | Low | Low | 1 day |

### **If You Can Only Build Two Things**

**1. Caching Infrastructure** (Highest Impact)
- **Why**: PreFlight validation becomes the bottleneck without caching
- **Components**: sccache, persistent rust-analyzer, memoized Cozo queries
- **Impact**: Sub-5s validation per candidate vs 30-60s cold starts
- **Implementation**: Native tool integration, no custom logic needed

**2. Deterministic Retrieval + ContextPack** (Second Highest)
- **Why**: Reduces reasoning load and eliminates wasted candidates
- **Components**: 2-hop CALLS/DEPENDS traversal, compressed context packing
- **Impact**: 4-10x less irrelevant context for reasoning model
- **Implementation**: Datalog queries + JSON artifact standardization

### **Minimal Viable Pattern Set v0**

**Three High-Yield Rust Fixes** (70% coverage of common bugs):

1. **async_spawn_send**
   - **Trigger**: "cannot be sent between threads", "future cannot be shared"
   - **Transform**: Add `Send + 'static` bounds to async function parameters
   - **Template**: `fn spawn<F: Future + Send + 'static>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<F::Output>`

2. **lifetime_extend**
   - **Trigger**: "does not live long enough", "borrowed value does not live long enough"
   - **Transform**: Add lifetime parameters or use references
   - **Template**: `fn process<'a>(data: &'a str) -> &'a str`

3. **error_propagate**
   - **Trigger**: "unwrap() used on Result", "expect() used on Result"
   - **Transform**: Replace with `?` operator or explicit error handling
   - **Template**: `fn process() -> Result<T, Error> { ...? }`

### **Overcomplication Traps to Avoid**

**High-Complexity, Low-ROI Features**:
- Multi-agent orchestration systems
- Complex calibration models with logistic regression
- Full pattern libraries (100+ patterns)
- Cross-crate refactoring capabilities
- Advanced anti-pattern detection
- Time-travel UI and versioning
- IMPLEMENTS/HAS_MEMBER edge types
- Vector search as primary (vs hint)

**Why These Overcomplicate**:
- Add architectural complexity without proportional user value
- Increase maintenance burden and failure modes
- Distract from core job story of fast, reliable fixes
- Create calibration and tuning nightmares

### **Success Criteria for Minimal Architecture**

**Performance Targets**:
- **p50 Time to Validated Fix**: ≤90s (after initial indexing)
- **First-Try Success Rate**: ≥70% (3-pattern set)
- **Median Patch Size**: 1 file, ≤10 lines
- **Zero Regressions**: On unrelated test smoke subset

**Technical Metrics**:
- **ISG Build Time**: ≤3 minutes (one-time)
- **Query Performance**: <100ms (cached)
- **Validation Time**: 1-5s per candidate
- **Memory Usage**: ≤8GB (minimal footprint)

### **One-Week Execution Plan**

**Day 1-2: ISG v0 + Caching**
- Build interface_metadata + interface_relationships (CALLS/DEPENDS)
- Implement sccache + persistent rust-analyzer integration
- Add memoized Cozo query layer

**Day 2-3: Retrieval + Context**
- Implement 2-hop blast radius with node caps
- Create ContextPack v0 schema and compression logic
- Add stable UID generation

**Day 3-4: Pattern DB v0**
- Encode 3 patterns with signature transforms
- Add keyword trigger + vector hint logic
- Implement feasibility checks

**Day 4-5: Validation Pipeline**
- Short-circuit validation: fmt → check → failing tests
- Rule-based confidence gate
- Patch generation with rollback capability

**Day 6-7: Testing + Polish**
- Evaluate on 10-20 real bugs across 3 patterns
- Fix top 3 failure modes
- Performance tuning and documentation

### **The Shreyas Doshi Product Philosophy**

**Core Principles**:
- **Job Story First**: Every technical decision serves the "bug to patch in 90s" mission
- **Time to Value**: Prioritize features that reduce time-to-first-success
- **Simplicity Over Completeness**: Better to do 3 things perfectly than 100 things poorly
- **Measurable Impact**: Every feature has clear success metrics and ROI targets

**Decision Framework**:
1. **Does this reduce time to validated fix?**
2. **Does this increase first-try success rate?**
3. **Does this add minimal complexity for maximum value?**
4. **Can we implement this in <3 days with <2 developers?**

If any answer is "no", defer or simplify the feature.

### **Integration with P22 PreFlight Architecture**

**How Minimal Architecture Enhances PreFlight**:
- **Tighter Scoping**: Fewer, higher-quality candidates for validation
- **Faster Iteration**: Sub-5s validation enables rapid candidate testing
- **Reliable Patterns**: Signature-only fixes have predictable PreFlight behavior
- **Clear Rollback**: Structured edits make PreFlight failure recovery trivial

**PreFlight Amplification Effects**:
- **Caching**: Turns 30-60s validation into 1-5s feedback loop
- **Deterministic Retrieval**: Reduces candidate quantity by 4-10x
- **Pattern Constraints**: Ensures 95% PreFlight pass rate on first try

## Feasibility-Validated Architecture (P34 Mathematical Analysis)

### **Performance Mathematics Validation**

**LLM Throughput Calculations**:
- **Assumptions**: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B at 30-40 tokens/s on 16GB machine
- **Input**: 10-15K tokens (compressed context)
- **Output**: 300-800 tokens (generated diff)
- **Processing Time**:
  ```
  T_LLM = output_tokens / tokens_per_sec + KV_processing_overhead
  T_LLM ≈ 600/35 + 10-20s = 27-37 seconds
  ```

**Cargo Pipeline Benchmarks**:
- **fmt**: ~1s (trivial)
- **check**: 5-12s (warm incremental builds)
- **test build**: 6-10s (target compilation)
- **test execution**: 6-15s (impacted tests only)
- **Total Validation**: 18-38s

**Overall Feasibility**: 60-90s target achievable with:
- Workspace caching and incremental builds
- Impacted test selection (vs full suite)
- Parallel validation phases

### **Beaconized Context Packing Architecture**

**START/END Salience Engineering**:
```
==== BUG_SUMMARY ====
Error: E0277 cannot be sent between threads
Symptom: panic in spawn under load
Target: src/runtime.rs::spawn

==== REQUIRED_CONSTRAINTS ====
Required: where F: Future + Send + 'static
Current: where F: Future

==== PRIMARY_CODE ====
[function span + immediate deps]

==== RECOMMENDED_PATTERN ====
id: async_spawn_send
success_rate: 0.94

==== REQUIRED_CONSTRAINTS (RECAP) ====
Required: where F: Future + Send + 'static
```

**Dual-Anchor Strategy**:
- **Critical Duplication**: Error codes, one-sentence summary, required bounds, target signature
- **Section Sentinels**: Explicit beacons for START/END attention zones
- **Constraint Reinforcement**: Required constraints repeated at both START and END

### **Workspace-Aware Retrieval System**

**Feature-Conditioned Graph Traversal**:
```datalog
# 2-hop forward with feature filtering
?[to_uid, edge_type] :=
  *isg_edges { from_uid: $seed, to_uid, edge_type },
  *isg_edges { from_uid: to_uid, to_uid: next_uid, edge_type: next_edge },
  # Feature constraint enforcement
  *isg_constraints {
    uid: to_uid,
    constraint_type: "feature",
    constraint_data: $active_features
  }

# Impacted test selection
?[test_uid] :=
  *isg_edges { from_uid: test_uid, to_uid: dep, edge_type: "CALLS" },
  test_interfaces { uid: test_uid, is_test: true },
  changed(dep)
```

**Workspace Graph Integration**:
- **L0 Workspace Nodes**: Crates, packages, features, test targets
- **Edge Types**: WITHIN_CRATE, BETWEEN_CRATES, ENABLED_BY_FEATURE
- **Feature Filtering**: Avoid false-context from disabled features
- **Test Impact Analysis**: Reverse closure from changed UIDs to tests

### **Calibrated Confidence Engineering**

**Mathematical Confidence Model**:
```
p = σ(w₀ + w₁·coverage + w₂·agreement + w₃·consistency + w₄·static_precheck)
```

**Calibration Strategy**:
- **Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression**: Map component scores to calibrated probability
- **Auto-Apply Threshold**: p ≥ 0.8 for automatic application
- **User Confirmation**: p < 0.8 requires human review
- **Semantic Consistency Check**: Verify pattern pre-conditions satisfied by diff

**Semantic Consistency Validation**:
- **Pattern Pre-conditions**: Formal type variable positions and required bounds
- **Diff Verification**: Ensure changes actually add required constraints
- **AST Predicate Matching**: Anti-pattern detection with structural validation

### **Rust-Native Pattern Representation**

**Structured Pattern Schema**:
```json
{
  "id": "async_spawn_send",
  "applies_to": {
    "fn_name": "spawn",
    "generic": "F",
    "constraints_missing": ["Send", "'static"],
    "where_clause_site": "fn"
  },
  "transform": {
    "action": "add_bounds",
    "on": "generic:F",
    "bounds": ["Send", "'static"]
  },
  "examples": [
    "pub fn spawn<F>(f: F) where F: Future + Send + 'static { ... }"
  ],
  "preconditions": [
    "F: Future",
    "spawn called across threads"
  ],
  "metrics": { "success_rate": 0.94 }
}
```

**Pattern Matching Engine**:
- **Formal Pre-conditions**: Type variable positions and bound requirements
- **Anti-Pattern Matchers**: AST predicates for bad practice detection
- **Example Code**: Placeholders with rewriter specifications
- **Success Metrics**: Historical effectiveness tracking per pattern

### **Multi-Crate Architecture Support**

- **Incremental Compilation**: cargo check --profile=dev with sccache integration
- **Test Optimization**: cargo test --no-run for impact analysis, then selective execution

**Error Routing and Canonicalization**:
- **Error Code Extraction**: E-codes and trait bound diffs for prompt reinforcement
- **Canonical Error Format**: Consistent error representation to avoid prompt drift

---

## Accuracy-First Architecture (P34 Optimization Strategy)

### **Primary Focus: First-Try Correctness Over Speed**

**Core Philosophy Shift**:
- **Speed**: Secondary (3-10 minutes per fix acceptable)
- **Accuracy**: Primary target (95-98% first-try success)
- **Approach**: Pattern DB → Micro-PRD → ISG_future → Deep Validation → Apply Once → Learn

**Why Accuracy First**: Optimize for "one-and-done" fixes with minimal regressions, even if it costs more time per run. Developer trust and reliability are more valuable than raw speed.

### **Reprioritized KPI Framework**

| Priority | Metric | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Primary** | First-try success rate | ≥95% (compile + tests + validators) | Developer trust and reliability |
| **Secondary** | Regression rate in CI | ≤1% post-merge | Production stability |
| **Tertiary** | Idiomaticity score | ≥0.95 | Code quality and maintainability |
| **Tertiary** | Diff minimality | ≥0.85 | Surgical, reviewable changes |
| **Monitoring** | Latency | Monitored but not gated | Performance tracking without sacrificing accuracy |

### **Enhanced Discovery Pipeline (Broader, Safer Coverage)**

**Retrieval Optimization for Accuracy**:
- **A2 Exact Retrieval**: Radius 3 hops (was 2), cap 50 nodes/hop with salience scoring
- **A3 Vector Retrieval**: K=30 (was 15), bias by pattern hints and active features
- **Workspace Awareness**: Complete cargo metadata integration with feature-aware edge filtering
- **Symmetric Analysis**: Include callers and callees for target functions
- **Type-Level Context**: Pull adjacent trait-bound and lifetime nodes

**Feature-Conditioned Analysis**:
```rust
// Active feature vector management
struct FeatureContext {
    active_features: HashSet<String>,
    ci_feature_union: Option<HashSet<String>>,
    mode: FeatureMode // Active | ActiveAndCI
}

// Edge filtering by feature conditions
fn filter_edges_by_features(edges: Vec<ISGEdge>, context: &FeatureContext) -> Vec<ISGEdge> {
    edges.into_iter()
        .filter(|edge| is_edge_enabled(edge, &context.active_features))
        .collect()
}
```

### **Multi-Crate Architecture Support**

- **Macro Expansion Tracking**: ISG nodes for generated code with hygiene preservation
- **Span Mapping**: Map generated code back to original source via rust-analyzer spans
- **Build Script Integration**: Include build.rs generated code in ISG analysis
- **Generated Code Warnings**: Alert when patches target generated code

**Cross-Crate Dependency Management**:
```datalog
// Cross-crate edge generation
?[cross_crate_edge] :=
  *isg_edges { from_uid: source_uid, to_uid: target_uid, edge_type: "BETWEEN_CRATES" },
  *cargo_metadata { source_crate: source_crate, target_crate: target_crate },
  *workspace_nodes { uid: source_uid, crate: source_crate },
  *workspace_nodes { uid: target_uid, crate: target_crate }
```

**Workspace Graph Integration**:
- **L0 Workspace Nodes**: Crates, packages, features, test targets
- **Edge Types**: WITHIN_CRATE, BETWEEN_CRATES, ENABLED_BY_FEATURE
- **Feature Filtering**: Respect active feature sets for current run
- **Test Impact Analysis**: Reverse closure from changed UIDs to dependent tests

### **Pattern-Enforced Validation Framework**

**Structured Pattern Records with Pre/Post Conditions**:
```json
{
  "id": "async_spawn_send",
  "applies_to": {
    "fn": "spawn",
    "generic": "F",
    "requires_present": ["F: Future"],
    "requires_missing": ["F: Send", "'static"]
  },
  "transform": {
    "action": "add_bounds",
    "site": "fn_where_clause",
    "target": "F",
    "bounds": ["Send", "'static"]
  },
  "preconditions": [
    "function signature analyzable",
    "generic type F identifiable",
    "no conflicting bounds present"
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "compiles without errors",
    "calls_to_spawn_cross_thread_ok",
    "no_unintended_Unpin_bound_added"
  ],
  "validation_checklist": [
    "trait bounds added to correct generic",
    "lifetime annotations preserved",
    "public API compatibility maintained"
  ],
  "metrics": { "success_rate": 0.94 }
}
```

**Pattern Verification Engine**:
- **Pre-Condition Checking**: Verify pattern applicability before transformation
- **Transform Validation**: Ensure changes match pattern specification exactly
- **Post-Condition Verification**: Validate that all required outcomes are achieved
- **Semantic Consistency**: Check that changes maintain logical coherence

### **Deep Validation Matrix (Sequential, Abort-on-Fail)**

**Core Validators (Always Run)**:
1. **cargo fmt --check**: Code formatting consistency
2. **cargo clippy -D warnings**: Lint compliance with deny warnings
3. **cargo check**: Compilation validation with active features
4. **Impacted Tests**: Selective test execution based on ISG analysis

**Extended Validators (Optional, Accuracy-Max Mode)**:
5. **Test Amplification**: Auto-generate property tests around changed APIs
6. **Sanitizers**: Address/Thread sanitizers for targeted test subset
7. **Miri Analysis**: cargo miri test for specific changed functions
8. **Semver Checks**: API stability verification for library crates
9. **Unsafe Surface**: cargo geiger for unsafe usage regression detection

**Validation Configuration**:
```toml
[journey.bug_fixing]
mode = "accuracy-first"
features = "active-and-ci"
enable_clippy = true
enable_semver_checks = true
enable_test_amplification = true
enable_sanitizers = "auto"
enable_miri = "targeted"
```

### **Multi-Candidate Generation and Selection**

**Ensemble Approach**:
- **Generate 2-3 Candidates**: Different pattern specializations at low temperature
- **Self-Consistency Check**: Verify each candidate against pattern pre/post-conditions
- **Lightweight Verifier**: Quick validation pass to identify champion candidate
- **Confidence Calibration**: Mathematical model for final acceptance decision

**Final Acceptance Formula**:
```
p_final = calibrate(0.30·coverage + 0.25·agreement + 0.25·consistency + 0.20·static_check)
```

**Apply Only If**: `p_final ≥ 0.90` AND all validation gates pass

### **Comprehensive Acceptance Checklist**

**Compilation Requirements**:
- [ ] Compile passes on selected feature matrix
- [ ] All impacted tests pass
- [ ] Amplified tests pass (if enabled)
- [ ] Clippy clean with -D warnings

**Pattern Compliance**:
- [ ] Pattern post-conditions satisfied
- [ ] Bounds/lifetimes/traits on correct generics
- [ ] No unintended public API break (or user-allowed)

**Quality Standards**:
- [ ] Diff minimality ≥ 0.85
- [ ] Idiomaticity ≥ 0.95
- [ ] Calibrated confidence ≥ 0.90

### **Test Impact Analysis and Amplification**

**Impacted Test Selection**:
```datalog
?[test_uid] :=
  changed { uid: dep_uid },
  *isg_edges { from_uid: test_uid, to_uid: dep_uid, edge_type: "CALLS" },
  *isg_nodes { uid: test_uid, is_test: true }
```

**Test Amplification Strategy**:
- **Property Test Generation**: Create tests around changed API boundaries
- **Regression Protection**: Amplified tests prevent future regressions
- **Targeted Focus**: Amplify only for critical code paths
- **Performance Awareness**: Balance coverage gains with test execution time

### **Mode Configuration System**

**Three Operating Modes**:

| Mode | Retrieval | Candidates | Validators | Time | Accuracy |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|------|----------|
| **Accuracy-First** | 3 hops, K=30 | 2–3 | Full suite + amplifiers | 3–10+ min | 95-98% |
| **Balanced** | 2–3 hops, K=20 | 2 | Core validators | 90–180 s | 90-95% |
| **Fast** | 2 hops, K=15 | 1 | Minimal validators | 60–90 s | 85-90% |

**Configuration Management**:
- **Per-Project Settings**: Repository-specific accuracy requirements
- **Feature Union Modes**: Active vs CI feature union strategies
- **Validator Toggles**: Enable/disable specific validation layers
- **Time Budget Controls**: Automatic mode switching based on time constraints

## Adaptive Multi-Candidate Architecture (P34 Zero-Write Validation)

### **Single vs Multiple Candidates Decision Framework**

**Core Insight**: A single "current ISG → future ISG → code" transform works for many fixes, but multiple candidates address ambiguity in edit locus, feature conditioning, and trade-offs between semver safety vs minimal diff.

**When Single Transform Succeeds**:
- Clear pre/post-conditions with unambiguous edit locus
- Local, monotonic edits without public API impact
- Single valid solution space (e.g., add Send bounds to function where-clause)

**When Multiple Candidates Needed**:
- **Ambiguous Edit Locus**: Add Send bounds where? fn where-clause, impl block, trait method, or generic type
- **Feature-Conditioned Code**: Different cfg(feature) branches require different edits
- **Procedural Macro Handling**: Visible span vs real anchor differ (source vs post-expansion)
- **Lifetime Strategy Options**: Extend lifetime vs move/clone vs restructure return type
- **Executor Choice**: spawn vs spawn_local with Send constraints
- **API Stability Trade-offs**: Two valid fixes - one breaks public API, other keeps internal

### **Structured Candidate Enumeration**

**Parameterized Candidate Space**:
```rust
enum Locus { FnWhere, ImplWhere, TraitBound }
enum BoundSet { SendOnly, SendAndStatic }
enum ExecutorStrategy { Spawn, SpawnLocal }
enum LifetimeStrategy { Own, Clone, Extend }

fn enumerate_candidates(ctx: &TransformContext) -> Vec<Candidate> {
    let mut candidates = Vec::new();

    for locus in [Locus::FnWhere, Locus::ImplWhere] {
        for bounds in [BoundSet::SendOnly, BoundSet::SendAndStatic] {
            if preconditions_hold(ctx, locus, bounds) {
                candidates.push(apply_transform(ctx, locus, bounds));
            }
        }
    }
    candidates
}
```

**Adaptive Minimal Ensemble Policy**:
1. **Primary Deterministic**: Build FutureSpec from pattern pre/post-conditions
2. **Validation Pipeline**: Run full validator matrix on primary candidate
3. **Conditional Expansion**: If any gate fails or confidence near-threshold, enumerate up to 2 targeted alternates
4. **Champion Selection**: Choose first candidate passing all gates with optimal score

**Mathematical Selection Criteria**:
```
ĉ = argmax_{c ∈ C} s(c)  s.t.  V(c) = pass
```
- `V(c)`: Validators (compile, tests, clippy, semver, post-conditions) must pass
- `s(c)`: Score combining minimality, idiomaticity, historical pattern success

### **Zero-Write Validation Architecture**

**Rust-Analyzer LSP Preflight (In-Memory)**:
```rust
// LSP-based validation without disk writes
struct RustAnalyzerPreflight {
    lsp_client: LspClient,
    workspace_root: PathBuf,
}

impl RustAnalyzerPreflight {
    fn validate_candidate(&mut self, candidate: &Candidate) -> ValidationResult {
        // Send in-memory overlays via LSP
        for (file_path, content) in candidate.edits() {
            self.lsp_client.did_open(file_path, content);
            self.lsp_client.did_change(file_path, content);
        }

        // Wait for diagnostics without repo writes
        let diags = self.lsp_client.wait_for_diagnostics(Duration::from_secs(5));

        // Filter for blocking errors
        if diags.has_blocking_errors() {
            ValidationResult::Blocked(diags)
        } else {
            ValidationResult::Passed(diags)
        }
    }
}
```

**Shadow Workspace Validation (Ephemeral Overlay)**:
```rust
fn create_shadow_workspace(repo: &Path, candidate_id: &str, edits: &[(String, String)]) -> PathBuf {
    let overlay = temp_dir().join("parseltongue").join(hash(repo)).join(candidate_id);

    // Mirror repository with hardlinks/symlinks
    mirror_repository(repo, &overlay);

    // Materialize only edited files
    for (rel_path, content) in edits {
        let full_path = overlay.join(rel_path);
        fs::create_dir_all(full_path.parent().unwrap())?;
        fs::write(full_path, content)?;
    }

    overlay
}

fn validate_in_shadow(overlay: &Path, features: &[&str]) -> ValidationResult {
    let mut cargo = Command::new("cargo")
        .current_dir(overlay)
        .env("CARGO_TARGET_DIR", "/tmp/parseltongue/target") // Shared cache
        .arg("check")
        .arg("--message-format=json")
        .args(features.iter().flat_map(|f| ["--features", f]))
        .output()?;

    parse_cargo_output(&cargo.stdout)
}
```

### **Integration with Existing Architecture**

**Candidate Assembly in CozoDB**:
```json
{

  },

**Validation Pipeline Integration**:
1. **Discovery**: Pattern-guided discovery → Micro-PRD → ISG_future
2. **Candidate Generation**: Enumerate 1-3 structured candidates from same FutureSpec
3. **LSP Preflight**: rust-analyzer overlays for immediate type/trait validation
4. **Shadow Validation**: Full cargo pipeline in ephemeral workspaces
5. **Champion Selection**: First candidate passing all gates with optimal score
6. **Real Repo Application**: Atomic git apply only for champion candidate

### **Concurrency and Caching Strategy**

**Parallel Candidate Processing**:
```rust
async fn validate_candidates_parallel(
    candidates: Vec<Candidate>,
    workspace_root: &Path
) -> Vec<ValidatedCandidate> {
    let mut tasks = Vec::new();

    for candidate in candidates {
        let root = workspace_root.to_path_buf();
        tasks.push(tokio::spawn(async move {
            // LSP preflight (fast)
            let lsp_result = rust_analyzer_preflight(&candidate, &root).await;
            if lsp_result.is_blocked() {
                return ValidatedCandidate::Rejected(candidate.id, lsp_result);
            }

            // Shadow validation (thorough)
            let overlay = create_shadow_workspace(&root, &candidate.id, &candidate.edits());
            let shadow_result = validate_in_shadow(&overlay, &candidate.features);

            ValidatedCandidate::Complete(candidate, lsp_result, shadow_result)
        }));
    }

    futures::future::join_all(tasks).await
}
```

**Cache Optimization**:
- **Shared Target Directory**: `/tmp/parseltongue/target` for all candidates
- **sccache Integration**: Reuse compiled dependencies across candidates
- **Incremental Compilation**: Leverage cargo incremental compilation
- **Feature Isolation**: Separate caches per feature combination if varying features

### **Test Amplification Strategy**

**Proptest Generation for Changed APIs**:
```rust
fn generate_amplified_tests(candidate: &Candidate) -> Vec<TestTemplate> {
    match candidate.pattern_id {
        "async_spawn_send" => vec![
            TestTemplate::spawn_send_proptest(),
            TestTemplate::concurrent_stress_test(),
        ],
        "lifetime_extend" => vec![
            TestTemplate::borrow_lifetime_proptest(),
            TestTemplate::ownership_transfer_test(),
        ],
        _ => Vec::new(),
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod amplified {
    use super::*;
    use proptest::prelude::*;

    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn spawn_does_not_panic_for_send_futures(n in 1u32..1000) {
            let fut = async move { n + 1 };
            // Protected by Send + 'static requirement
            spawn(fut);
        }
    }
}
```

## **Journey-Aware Intelligence Tools**

### **Parseltongue Runtime Orchestrator**
- **Purpose**: Journey-specific orchestration engine that configures and manages parallel sub-agent workflows based on user intent
- **Inputs**: Journey type (bug-fixing | pattern-research | academic-research), user query, workspace context
- **Outputs**: Journey-configured execution plan with optimized agent allocation and resource budgeting
- **Actions**: Analyze user intent, select journey template, configure agent pools, allocate resources, execute phase-separated workflow
- **Variants**: (a) CLI orchestrator; (b) VS Code extension; (c) Web interface; (d) API service
- **Notes**: Each journey has distinct optimization targets - speed for bug fixing, coverage for pattern research, depth for academic research
- **Example CLI**: parseltongue-runtime --journey bug-fixing --query "E0277 Send trait error in async spawn" --timeout 60s
- **Example Input**: {"journey":"bug-fixing","query":"Add Send bound to async function","workspace":".","context":{"error":"E0277","file":"src/runtime.rs"}}
- **Example Output**: {"execution_plan":{"agents":8,"phases":4,"budget":{"tokens":40000,"memory_mb":9000},"estimated_time":60}}
- **Diverse Ideas**:
  * **Adaptive Journey Selection**: Automatic journey detection based on query patterns and user behavior; switches between bug-fixing, pattern-research, and academic modes
  * **Dynamic Resource Scaling**: Real-time resource allocation based on available memory/CPU; automatically scales agent pools and model sizes for optimal performance
  * **Journey Performance Benchmarking**: Continuous performance tracking across journey types with SLO enforcement and automatic optimization
  * **Cross-Journey Learning**: Knowledge transfer between journeys - bug fixes inform pattern research, which improves academic synthesis
  * **User Intent Evolution**: Learns from user interactions to refine journey selection and agent configuration over time
  * **Multi-Journey Workflows**: Composite workflows that chain multiple journeys (e.g., pattern research → bug fixing → validation)
  * **Journey Templates Marketplace**: Community-curated journey templates for specific domains (embedded systems, web services, ML pipelines)

### **Journey Configuration Designer**
- **Purpose**: Visual designer for creating and customizing journey-specific agent configurations and execution plans
- **Inputs**: Journey template JSON, agent specifications, performance requirements, resource constraints
- **Outputs**: Validated journey configuration with performance predictions and resource estimates
- **Actions**: Configure agent pools, set quality gates, define phase transitions, specify validation requirements, estimate resource usage
- **Variants**: (a) GUI designer; (b) CLI generator; (c) Template marketplace integration; (d) Configuration validator
- **Notes**: Enforces journey-specific best practices while allowing deep customization for specialized use cases
- **Example CLI**: journey-designer --template bug-fixing --agents 8 --memory-budget 12GB --validation cargo-check,cargo-test
- **Example Input**: {"journey":"pattern-research","agents":15,"phases":{"parallel":{"timeout":"15s"},"reasoning":{"timeout":"30s"}},"quality_gates":{"cluster_purity":0.7}}
- **Example Output**: {"config":{"valid":true,"estimated_performance":{"latency":"45s","memory_mb":"9.5GB","agents":15},"warnings":["large_agent_count_may_impact_performance"]}}
- **Diverse Ideas**:
  * **Performance Prediction Engine**: Machine learning-based performance estimation for journey configurations using historical data and hardware profiling
  * **Resource Budget Calculator**: Automatic resource allocation based on hardware capabilities and journey requirements with safety margins
  * **Quality Gate Builder**: Visual configuration of validation criteria with real-time feedback on expected pass rates
  * **Agent Marketplace**: Community marketplace for pre-built agent configurations optimized for specific patterns and domains
  * **Journey Template Evolution**: Automatic improvement of journey templates based on performance data and user feedback
  * **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Pareto-optimal journey configurations balancing speed, accuracy, and resource usage
  * **Journey A/B Testing**: Automated testing of journey variations to identify optimal configurations

### **Multi-Agent Pool Manager**
- **Purpose**: Manages pools of specialized agents with different capabilities and resource requirements for parallel execution
- **Inputs**: Agent pool configuration, journey requirements, available resources, performance constraints
- **Outputs**: Optimized agent allocation and scheduling plan with load balancing and resource management
- **Actions**: Pool initialization, agent provisioning, load balancing, resource monitoring, health checking, failure recovery
- **Variants**: (a) Local pool manager; (b) Distributed pool orchestrator; (c) Cloud pool connector; (d) Hybrid pool coordinator
- **Notes**: Supports hot-swapping of agent implementations and dynamic scaling based on workload demands
- **Example CLI**: agent-pool-manager --config pools.yaml --journey bug-fixing --scale auto --health-check 30s
- **Example Input**: {"pools":{"search":{"size":2,"model":"miniLM-22M","memory_mb":200},"reasoning":{"size":1,"model":"qwen-14B","memory_mb":4000}}}
- **Example Output**: {"allocation":{"search":2,"reasoning":1,"total_memory_mb":4200,"estimated_latency":"45s"},"health":"all_agents_healthy"}
- **Diverse Ideas**:
  * **Intelligent Load Balancing**: Predictive load distribution based on agent capabilities and task complexity with automatic rebalancing
