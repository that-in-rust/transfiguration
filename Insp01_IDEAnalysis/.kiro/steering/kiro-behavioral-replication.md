# Kiro Behavioral Replication Principles

## Core Philosophy

**Goal**: Create a Rust/WASM implementation that provides the EXACT Kiro experience with superior performance and security. Users should be able to switch from Electron Kiro to Rust/WASM Kiro and have identical workflows, just with better performance.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Behavioral Indistinguishability
- Every user-facing behavior must be replicated exactly
- Muscle memory preservation is critical (shortcuts, workflows, UI patterns)
- Visual consistency must be maintained down to pixel-level accuracy
- Feature parity is non-negotiable - no missing functionality

### 2. Kiro as Specification
- Treat the existing Kiro application as a living specification to implement
- Every configuration option, menu item, and interaction pattern must be documented and replicated
- Extension API surface area must be 100% compatible
- All built-in commands and their exact behaviors must be preserved

### 3. Performance Enhancement, Not Replacement
- Rust/WASM provides the performance benefits, not UX changes
- Startup time, memory usage, and AI response times should exceed Kiro benchmarks
- All performance improvements must be transparent to the user experience
- Maintain identical timing for animations and transitions

### 4. Systematic Analysis Requirements
All requirements must include:
- **Static Analysis**: Configuration files, extension APIs, command structures
- **Dynamic Analysis**: User interaction flows, performance profiling, network patterns
- **Behavioral Testing**: Side-by-side comparison with original Kiro
- **Migration Path**: Seamless transition from Electron to Rust/WASM version

## Implementation Guidelines

### User Journey Mapping
Every requirement must specify:
- Exact UI loading sequences and splash screen behavior
- Workspace restoration and panel layout states
- AI interaction patterns and streaming response display
- Extension installation and management flows
- File system integration and Git workflow behaviors

### Compatibility Matrix
Requirements must ensure:
- VS Code extension API surface compatibility
- Kiro-specific extension APIs preservation
- Configuration file format compatibility
- Workspace file structure compatibility
- Settings and preferences system matching

### Performance Targets
All implementations must:
- Exceed current Kiro performance benchmarks
- Maintain sub-second AI response times
- Reduce memory usage while preserving functionality
- Achieve faster startup times than Electron version

### Validation Criteria
Every feature must pass:
- Behavioral testing against original Kiro
- User journey validation with existing Kiro users
- Extension compatibility verification
- Performance regression testing
- Visual consistency confirmation

## Architecture Constraints

### Rust/WASM Distribution
- **Pure Rust**: File system operations, parsing, AI processing, performance-critical paths
- **WASM Bindings**: UI interactions, extension runtime, JavaScript compatibility layer
- **JavaScript Compatibility**: Maintain extension ecosystem without breaking changes
- **Native Performance**: Leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions for speed improvements

### Migration Strategy
- Import existing Kiro workspaces without modification
- Transfer all settings and preferences seamlessly
- Maintain project and configuration data compatibility
- Provide transparent upgrade path for users

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- Side-by-side behavioral comparison testing
- Extension compatibility test suite
- Performance benchmark validation
- User acceptance testing with Kiro power users
- Regression testing for all user workflows

### Success Metrics
- 100% feature parity with original Kiro
- Measurable performance improvements (startup, memory, AI response)
- Zero breaking changes for existing users
- Seamless migration experience
- Extension ecosystem compatibility maintained

## Development Process

### Analysis Phase
1. Extract and document all Kiro behaviors systematically
2. Create comprehensive user journey maps
3. Profile performance characteristics and bottlenecks
4. Document extension API surface area completely
5. Map all configuration and customization options

### Implementation Phase
1. Build Rust/WASM components with behavioral fidelity as primary goal
2. Implement JavaScript compatibility layer for extensions
3. Replicate UI/UX patterns with pixel-perfect accuracy
4. Maintain identical keyboard shortcuts and command structures
5. Preserve all customization and theming capabilities

### Validation Phase
1. Continuous behavioral testing against original Kiro
2. Performance benchmarking and optimization
3. Extension compatibility verification
4. User acceptance testing and feedback incorporation
5. Migration path testing and refinement

This steering document ensures that every aspect of the Rust/WASM Kiro implementation prioritizes behavioral fidelity while delivering the performance and security benefits of native code.
