# A009: Focus Session 2025-10-14 Phase 1

## Session Overview
Focus session for strategic evolution of Parseltongue and related tooling, with emphasis on comparative analysis between existing implementations and emerging patterns.

## Repository Management Strategy

### New Git Clones Location
All new git clones for analysis will be stored in:
