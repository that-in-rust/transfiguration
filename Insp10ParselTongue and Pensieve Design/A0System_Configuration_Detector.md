### Low-Level Design

**1. Goal**
To create a Rust program that returns a single boolean value indicating whether the host system is an Apple Silicon device (M1/M2/M3, etc.) with 16 gigabytes of RAM or more.

**2. Core Logic & Data Flow**
The program will execute a series of checks in a specific order. The final result is a logical `AND` of all conditions.

- **Step 1: System Information Acquisition**

  - The program needs to query the operating system for hardware and software details.
  - Since Rust's standard library lacks a cross-platform API for this, an external crate is required. The `sysinfo` crate is the optimal choice as it provides a high-level, unified API for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Initialize the `sysinfo::System` object and refresh its data to ensure all information is current.

- **Step 2: Apple Silicon Identification (Condition A)**

  - This is a composite condition requiring two checks:
    - **OS Check:** Query the system's OS name. It must be equal to `"macOS"`.
    - **Architecture Check:** Query the CPU architecture. It must be `AARCH64`, the 64-bit ARM architecture used by Apple Silicon chips.
  - The result for this step is `is_macOS && is_aarch64`.

- **Step 3: Memory Check (Condition B)**

  - Query the total system memory from the `sysinfo` object.
  - The `sysinfo` crate returns memory in kilobytes (KB). This value must be converted to gigabytes (GB) for comparison.
  - The logic is `total_ram_in_gb >= 16`.

- **Step 4: Final Evaluation**
  - The final boolean output is the result of `Condition_A && Condition_B`.
  - If either condition is false, the final result is false.

**3. Program Structure**

- **Dependency:** The program will have one external dependency: `sysinfo`.
- **Core Function:** A dedicated function, e.g., `is_apple_silicon_with_16gb_plus_ram()`, will contain the logic from Steps 2 and 3. This function will encapsulate the implementation details and return a single `bool`. This promotes modularity and testability.
- **Entry Point (`main` function):** The `main` function will be responsible for:
  - Calling the core function.
  - Receiving the boolean result.
  - Printing a human-readable message to the console based on the result (e.g., "✅ True: ..." or "❌ False: ...").

### Prompt to Generate the Code

You can use the following prompt with a code-generation AI to produce the Rust program based on the design above.

**Prompt:**

"Generate a complete and runnable Rust program to check the system configuration.

**Objective:**
The program must determine if the current system is an Apple Silicon device with 16GB of RAM or more.

**Technical Requirements:**

1.  **Language:** Rust.
2.  **Dependency:** Use the `sysinfo` crate to get all system information. Include the `Cargo.toml` dependency in your response.
3.  **Core Logic:** Create a public function named `is_apple_silicon_with_16gb_plus_ram()` that returns a boolean.
    - Inside this function, check if the operating system is `macOS`.
    - Also, check if the CPU architecture is `AARCH64`.
    - Finally, check if the total system memory is greater than or equal to 16 GB.
    - The function should only return `true` if **all three** of these conditions are met.
4.  **Main Function:** The `main` function should call `is_apple_silicon_with_16gb_plus_ram()` and print a clear, user-friendly message to the console.
    - If the function returns `true`, print: `✅ True: This is an Apple Silicon device with 16GB+ of RAM.`
    - If the function returns `false`, print: `❌ False: This system does not meet the requirements.`

Please provide the full source code for `main.rs` and the necessary `Cargo.toml` entry."
