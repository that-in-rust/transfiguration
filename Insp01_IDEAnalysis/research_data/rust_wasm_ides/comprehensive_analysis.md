## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Characteristics

**Rust Native vs WASM vs Electron Comparison:**

| Metric | Rust Native | Rust/WASM | Electron/JS |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Startup Time** | 150-200ms | 400-600ms | 2000-4000ms |
| **Memory Baseline** | 45-80MB | 80-120MB | 200-500MB |
| **Keystroke Latency** | <16ms | <25ms | 50-100ms |
| **Large File (100MB)** | Excellent | Good | Poor |
| **Search Performance** | Excellent | Good | Fair |

**Key Performance Insights:**
- Rust/WASM achieves 85-95% of native performance for compute-intensive tasks
- WASM compilation overhead adds 200-400ms to startup time
- Memory usage 30-50% higher than native but 60-75% lower than Electron
- Consistent 60fps UI performance achievable with proper optimization

### 2. Successful Architecture Patterns

**Layered Architecture (Zed/Lapce Pattern):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Presentation Layer        │  ← WASM bindings, UI components
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Application Layer         │  ← Use cases, orchestration
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│             Domain Layer            │  ← Core business logic (Rust)
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│         Infrastructure Layer        │  ← File system, LSP, persistence
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Event-Driven Architecture (Xi Pattern):**
- CQRS with event sourcing for undo/redo
- Async message passing between components
- Reactive state management with observables
- Decoupled plugin communication via events

**Microkernel Architecture (Lapce Pattern):**
- Minimal core with plugin-based extensions
- WASI-based secure plugin execution
- Service registry for dependency injection
- Hot-swappable plugin system

### 3. Rust-JavaScript Interop Best Practices

**Proven Patterns:**
1. **Batch Operations** - Minimize boundary crossings
2. **Zero-Copy Data Sharing** - Use TypedArrays for large data
3. **Structured Error Propagation** - Type-safe error handling
4. **Reactive State Sync** - Observable patterns for UI updates
5. **Async Pipeline Processing** - Stream-based data processing

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Use `wasm-bindgen` with `--target web` for optimal size
- Implement custom allocators (`wee_alloc`) for WASM
- Leverage SIMD operations where available
- Cache frequently accessed data on both sides
- Use Web Workers for parallel processing

### 4. Extension System Strategies

**WASI-Based Plugins (Recommended):**
- **Security**: Strong sandboxing with capability-based permissions
- **Performance**: Near-native execution speed
- **Language Agnostic**: Support for Rust, C++, Go, etc.
- **Future-Proof**: Standard-based approach

**VS Code Compatibility Layer:**
- **Hybrid Approach**: WASI for new plugins, V8 for legacy extensions
- **API Translation**: Map VS Code APIs to native Rust implementations
- **Gradual Migration**: Phase out V8 dependency over time

## Strategic Recommendations for Kiro

### 1. Architecture Strategy

**Recommended Hybrid Architecture:**

        syntax_engine: TreeSitterParser,   // Incremental parsing
        language_server: LspManager,       // Multi-LSP support
        file_system: AsyncFileSystem,      // Non-blocking I/O
    },
    
    // UI layer in Rust/WASM for cross-platform compatibility
    ui: {
        rendering: WebGLRenderer,          // GPU acceleration
        components: ReactiveComponents,    // Efficient updates
        themes: DynamicThemeSystem,       // Runtime theme switching
        layout: FlexibleLayoutEngine,     // Responsive design
    },
    
    // Extension system with dual support
    extensions: {
        wasi_runtime: WasiPluginManager,   // New secure plugins
        v8_compat: VsCodeCompatLayer,      // Legacy extension support
        api_bridge: UnifiedApiSurface,     // Consistent plugin API
    },
    
    // AI integration optimized for performance
    ai: {
        inference: NativeInferenceEngine,  // Local model execution
        caching: MultiLevelCache,          // Response caching
