Question does auto-complete work here

It seems to work

Ok the user journey in my mind 


``` text

1. User arrives at the codebase via claude-code fork called Parseltongue
2. Interface Signature Graph is created in RAM as ISG01
    - each node is an interface signature with a unique identifier
        - the identifier is filePath-fileName-InterfaceName where InterfaceName is defined such a way that it remains unique
    - any interface is a limited set of things but ALL of them should be at first level of distance from filename, which means interfaces which are inside other interfaces are not of relevant concern
    - the interface signature is enriched with meta-data from rust analyzer
        - might include HIR information
        - might include any information that helps understand what is the utility of this interface
        - might include any dependencies or etc. analytics related to its relationships with other interfaces
        - classification label of whether it is a test interface used for TDD or a normal interface
    - a persistent copy is created in a relevant graph database maybe CosData
    - a persistent copy is created in a JSON file
    - a visualization in HTML based on ISG which can help the user understand
        - control flow of codebase
        - overall structure of code
3. The codebase is copied into SQLlite database
    - Table Codebase has following columns
        - id
        - filePath-fileName-interfaceName as unique identifier
        - Current_Code
        - Future_Code (empty at initiation)
        - Future_Action (empty at initiation, but filled with whether to suit the PRD change we will edit or delete or create this new interface)
4. The user is asked to create a PRD
    - The LLM asks the user to refine
