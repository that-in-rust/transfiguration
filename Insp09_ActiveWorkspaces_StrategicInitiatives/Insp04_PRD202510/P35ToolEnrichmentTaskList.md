Scope
- Directory: current folder only
- Files included: P*.md
- Excluded: this file
- Batch size: ~300 lines per task
- Prompt : Just update P25*.md file with the mindset of 1000 IQ Shreyas Doshi Jeff Dean - How you can add more diverse ideas to the tools that we have - in P25*.md -- keep the format same but enrich what is there based on your reading of the files that there in these tasks - and mark a checkmark in the task list below # Planned batches
