# A010: User Journey 01 - Parseltongue (Claude Code Evolution)

## Primary User Persona

### "The Rust Developer Joining an Existing Codebase"

**Profile:**
- **Experience**: Solid Rust developer (comfortable with ownership, lifetimes, traits)
- **Context**: New to a specific codebase (5,000+ lines of Rust code)
- **Three main scenarios**:
  A. **Issue Resolution**: Debugging and fixing problems in unfamiliar code
  B. **Feature Development**: Adding new functionality to existing architecture
  C. **Refactoring**: Improving code structure, performance, or maintainability

**Key Pain Points:**
- Understanding complex module interactions and dependency chains
- Navigating unfamiliar architectural patterns
- Identifying the "right way" to make changes without breaking existing invariants
- Mental overhead of building context in a large, established codebase
- Risk-averse changes (fear of introducing regressions)

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to first productive contribution
- Confidence in making changes without breaking things
- Ability to understand codebase architecture and patterns quickly
- Quality of contributions (bug-free, idiomatic Rust)
