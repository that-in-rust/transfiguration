## Executive Summary

**Job to Be Done:** Help Rust developers make fast, confident contributions to OSS projects, even when new to the codebase.

**Primary User:** Rust developer who wants to contribute to OSS but doesn't know where to start or how to avoid breaking things.

**Key Innovation:** Interface Signature Graph (ISG) + Dual-State Architecture that shows architectural structure and simulates changes before implementation.

## User Journey: Install → First Contribution

### Phase 0: System Validation & Installation (0-10 minutes)

#### Job: "Is this going to work on my system and is it worth installing?"

**User Concern:** "I don't want to waste time on tools that won't work or require complex setup."

**Experience Design:**
```bash
# One-command system validation
curl -sSL https://get.parseltongue.sh | sh

# Intelligent system check
✓ Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3 detected - optimized
✓ 16GB+ RAM found - sufficient for model
✓ Rust 1.70+ installed - compatible
⚠  Ollama not found - installing Qwen 2.5-Coder 7B Q4_K_M (~4.25GB)
✓ Model download: 60-90 tokens/sec, 128k context
✓ System ready: <5s codebase analysis, <1ms queries
```

🏗️  Core Architecture (3 main layers):
   1. API Layer (421 interfaces)
      - HTTP handlers, request/response models
      - Authentication middleware
      - Rate limiting and validation

   2. Business Logic (312 interfaces)
      - Domain models, service layer
      - Business rules and validation
      - Event handling and workflows

   3. Data Layer (214 interfaces)
      - Database repositories, query builders
      - Data access objects, caching layer
      - Migration and schema management

🔗 Key Dependencies:
   API Layer → Business Logic → Data Layer
   All layers depend on shared error handling and logging

💡 Contribution Opportunities:
   - High Impact: API layer rate limiting enhancement
   - Low Risk: Data layer query optimization
   - Learning: Business logic feature addition
```

**Architecture Differentiator:** Interface-centric understanding vs code-level analysis
```rust

pub struct ArchitecturalIntelligence {
    pub pattern_detector: LayerIdentification,
    pub dependency_mapper: InterfaceRelationshipMapper,
    pub opportunity_ranker: ImpactVsRiskAnalyzer,
    pub explainer: NaturalLanguageArchitecturalDescription,
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Comprehensive architectural understanding in < 5 minutes
- ✅ Risk-assessed contribution opportunities
- ✅ Clear mental model of codebase structure

### Phase 3: Safe Contribution Planning (1-2 hours)

#### Job: "Help me plan a change that won't break everything"

**User Concern:** "I want to contribute but I'm afraid of introducing regressions."

**Experience Design:**
```bash
$ parseltongue propose "Add rate limiting to API endpoints"

🎯 Change Impact Analysis:
   • Interfaces to modify: 12 (API layer)
   • Interfaces to add: 3 (rate limiting service)
   • Blast radius: API layer only (isolated)
   • Risk level: LOW (well-contained change)

🔬 Predictive Simulation:
   Current Request Flow:
   Client → HTTP Handler → Service → Database

   Proposed Request Flow:
   Client → Rate Limiter → HTTP Handler → Service → Database

⚠️  Identified Risks:
   - Rate limiter performance bottleneck (mitigation: Redis cache)
   - Existing client compatibility (mitigation: gradual rollout)
   - Testing complexity (mitigation: integration test templates)

✅ Change Safety Score: 8.5/10

📋 Implementation Plan:
   1. Create rate limiting service (2 interfaces)
   2. Add rate limiting middleware (1 interface)
   3. Update API handlers to use middleware (12 interfaces)
   4. Add comprehensive tests (existing patterns)
   5. Update documentation (README + API docs)

💡 Pro Tip: Start with a single endpoint for validation
```

**Architecture Differentiator:** Dual-state architecture with predictive simulation
```rust
// Change simulation with risk assessment
pub struct ChangeSimulator {
    pub impact_analyzer: BlastRadiusCalculator,
    pub dependency_checker: InterfaceDependencyGraph,

## Technical Architecture

### Core Innovation: Interface Signature Graph (ISG)

**Differentiator:** Analyzes interfaces instead of code

```rust
// Traditional approach: Line-by-line code analysis
pub struct CodeAnalysis {
    pub ast_parser: SyntaxTreeParser,           // Complex, fragile
    pub code_analyzer: InstructionAnalyzer,     // Implementation details
    pub pattern_matcher: CodePatternMatcher,   // Brittle heuristics
}

// Parseltongue approach: Interface-level understanding
pub struct InterfaceSignatureGraph {
    pub interface_extractor: InterfaceSignatureExtractor, // Robust
    pub relationship_mapper: InterfaceRelationshipMapper, // Stable
    pub pattern_recognizer: ArchitecturalPatternRecognizer, // Accurate
}
```

**Key Technical Advantages:**
1. **Stability:** Interfaces change rarely vs implementation churn
2. **Accuracy:** Architectural understanding vs code trivia
3. **Performance:** Interface graphs are small and fast to query
4. **Predictability:** Interface changes have predictable impact

### Dual-State Architecture: Risk Reduction

**Approach:** Simulate changes before implementing them

```rust
// Parallel universes of code
pub struct DualStateArchitecture {
    pub isg_current: InterfaceSignatureGraph,  // Reality
    pub isg_future: InterfaceSignatureGraph,    // Vision
    pub change_simulator: ImpactPredictor,     // Bridge
    pub validation_engine: SafetyValidator,     // Gatekeeper
}

// Change simulation before implementation
impl ChangeSimulator {
    fn simulate_change(&self, change: &Change) -> SimulationResult {
        // Apply change to ISG_future (not real code)
        let future_isg = self.apply_change_to_future(change);

        // Analyze impact across interface graph
        let impact = self.analyze_interface_impact(&future_isg);

        // Predict test failures and compilation issues
        let risks = self.identify_potential_breakages(&future_isg);

        // Generate mitigation strategies
        let mitigations = self.generate_mitigation_strategies(&risks);

        SimulationResult { impact, risks, mitigations }
    }
}
```

### Performance Advantages

**Performance metrics:**

```rust
pub struct PerformanceGuarantees {
    // SLA-grade performance contracts

    pub speed_multiplier: "1000x faster than manual review",
    pub cost_reduction: "50x lower AI token costs",
    pub quality_improvement: "5x higher PR acceptance rates",
}
```

### Opinionated Stack: Simplified Choices

**Decision reduction - pre-selected optimal choices:**

```rust
pub struct OpinionatedArchitecture {
    // Language and Platform
    pub language: "Rust (native performance, zero-cost abstractions)",
    pub target: "Apple Silicon 16GB+ (optimized memory usage)",
