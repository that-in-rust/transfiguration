What we are a little sure about for Parseltongue at 202510160900 hrs


1. User arrives at the codebase via claude-code fork called Parseltongue
2. Interface Signature Graph is created in RAM as ISG_current
    - each node is an interface signature with a unique identifier
        - the identifier is filePath-fileName-InterfaceName where InterfaceName is defined such a way that it remains unique
    - any interface is a limited set of things but ALL of them should be at first level of distance from filename, which means interfaces which are inside other interfaces are not of relevant concern
    - the interface signature is enriched with meta-data from rust analyzer
        - might include HIR information
        - might include any information that helps understand what is the utility of this interface
        - might include any dependencies or etc. analytics related to its relationships with other interfaces
        - classification label of whether it is a test interface used for TDD or a normal interface
    - a persistent copy is created in a relevant graph database maybe CosData
    - a persistent copy is created in a JSON file
    - a visualization in HTML based on ISG which can help the user understand
        - control flow of codebase
        - overall structure of code
3. The codebase is copied into SQLlite database
    - Table Codebase has following columns
        - id
        - ISG_current_ind (0 or 1)
        - ISG_future_ind (0 or 1)
        - filePath-fileName-interfaceName as unique identifier
        - Current_Code
        - Future_Code (empty at initiation)
        - Future_Action (empty at initiation, but filled with whether to suit the PRD change we will edit or delete or create this new interface)
4. The user is asked to create a PRD
    - the LLM asks the user to refine the PRD in context of ISG_current
    - the PRD is created
5. The LLM is tasked with creating a new ISG_future which does not have a persistent copy based on
    - ISG_current + PRD
    - the LLM is asked if
        - Do we need to revise the PRD?
            - Yes
                - ISG_future is possible or NOT or should we ask for a PRD change based on whether the change is too big or too complicated - especially in terms of risks of different nature
            - No
                - if ISG_future is possible then lets have base value of ISG_current as a default value and then change it according to what you think is the correct logic
                    - what test-interfaces will be deleted, edited, created
                    - what non-test-interfaces will be deleted, edited, created
                - now reflect these ISG_future changes in the SQLlite database in ISG_current_ind, ISG_future_ind, Future_Code and Future_Action columns
                - now use the rubber duck debugging menthod to look at ISG_current + PRD + ISG_future + those rows in SQLlite database which have Future_Code and Future_Action columns as not null
                - if the LLM thinks that we need to refine the solutioning further, make changes to ISG_future and repeat the process
                - if the LLM thinks that we need to refine the PRD further then go back to previous step
                - if finally the LLM feels very confident of the changes, we reflect the changes in the SQLlite database in the codebase
                - now we run all the tests and compile the codebase
                - if the tests fail then we go back to previous step
                - if the tests pass then we show the visualization of changes in ISG to the user + results of compilation + tests + request behavorial confirmation
                - if user gives go ahead then we
                    - make a commit with list of changes
                    - recreate ISG_current from ISG_future; update the SQLlite database according to the current codebase from scratch
