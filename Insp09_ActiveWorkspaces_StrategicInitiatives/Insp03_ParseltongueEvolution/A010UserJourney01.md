# A010: User Journey 01 - Parseltongue (Claude Code Evolution)

## Primary User Persona

### "The Rust Developer Joining an Existing Codebase"

**Profile:**
- **Experience**: Solid Rust developer (comfortable with ownership, lifetimes, traits)
- **Context**: New to a specific codebase (5,000+ lines of Rust code)
- **Three main scenarios**:
  A. **Issue Resolution**: Debugging and fixing problems in unfamiliar code
  B. **Feature Development**: Adding new functionality to existing architecture
  C. **Refactoring**: Improving code structure, performance, or maintainability

**Key Pain Points:**
- Understanding complex module interactions and dependency chains
- Navigating unfamiliar architectural patterns
- Identifying the "right way" to make changes without breaking existing invariants
- Mental overhead of building context in a large, established codebase
- Risk-averse changes (fear of introducing regressions)

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to first productive contribution
- Confidence in making changes without breaking things
- Ability to understand codebase architecture and patterns quickly
- Quality of contributions (bug-free, idiomatic Rust)

## L1 PRD: Parseltongue Core User Journey

1. User arrives at the codebase via claude-code fork called Parseltongue
2. Interface Signature Graph is created in RAM as ISG_current
    - each node is an interface signature with a unique identifier
        - the identifier is filePath-fileName-InterfaceName where InterfaceName is defined such a way that it remains unique
    - any interface is a limited set of things but ALL of them should be at first level of distance from filename, which means interfaces which are inside other interfaces are not of relevant concern
    - the interface signature is enriched with meta-data from rust analyzer
        - might include HIR information
        - might include any information that helps understand what is the utility of this interface
        - might include any dependencies or etc. analytics related to its relationships with other interfaces
        - classification label of whether it is a test interface used for TDD or a normal interface
    - a persistent copy is created in a relevant graph database maybe CosData
    - a persistent copy is created in a JSON file
    - a visualization in HTML based on ISG which can help the user understand
        - control flow of codebase
        - overall structure of code
3. The codebase is copied into SQLlite database
    - Table Codebase has following columns
        - id
        - ISG_current_ind (0 or 1)
        - ISG_future_ind (0 or 1)
        - filePath-fileName-interfaceName as unique identifier
        - Current_Code
        - Future_Code (empty at initiation)
        - Future_Action (empty at initiation, but filled with whether to suit the PRD change we will edit or delete or create this new interface)
4. The user is asked to create a PRD
    - the LLM asks the user to refine the PRD in context of ISG_current
    - the PRD is created
5. The LLM is tasked with creating a new ISG_future which does not have a persistent copy based on
    - ISG_current + PRD
    - the LLM is asked if
        - Do we need to revise the PRD?
            - Yes
                - ISG_future is possible or NOT or should we ask for a PRD change based on whether the change is too big or too complicated - especially in terms of risks of different nature
            - No
                - if ISG_future is possible then lets have base value of ISG_current as a default value and then change it according to what you think is the correct logic
                    - what test-interfaces will be deleted, edited, created
                    - what non-test-interfaces will be deleted, edited, created
                - now reflect these ISG_future changes in the SQLlite database in ISG_current_ind, ISG_future_ind, Future_Code and Future_Action columns
                - now use the rubber duck debugging menthod to look at ISG_current + PRD + ISG_future + those rows in SQLlite database which have Future_Code and Future_Action columns as not null
                - if the LLM thinks that we need to refine the solutioning further, make changes to ISG_future and repeat the process
                - if the LLM thinks that we need to refine the PRD further then go back to previous step
                - if finally the LLM feels very confident of the changes, we reflect the changes in the SQLlite database in the codebase
                - now we run all the tests and compile the codebase
                - if the tests fail then we go back to previous step
                - if the tests pass then we show the visualization of changes in ISG to the user + results of compilation + tests + request behavorial confirmation
                - if user gives go ahead then we
                    - make a commit with list of changes
                    - recreate ISG_current from ISG_future; update the SQLlite database according to the current codebase from scratch

## OSS Mastery Strategy: The Hidden Strategic Play

### The Real Strategic Objective

**Dual-Purpose Weapon Architecture:**
Parseltongue serves as both a technical product and a strategic tool for demonstrating OSS mastery while accelerating contribution velocity through intelligent AI assistance.

**The Meta-Goal:** Position yourself as the most prolific and effective OSS contributor in the Rust ecosystem by leveraging AI tools that provide architectural intelligence at 90% lower token costs.

### Strategic OSS Positioning Analysis

**The False Premise of Traditional OSS:**
Most OSS developers believe that "more features = more users = more success." This creates feature bloat, slows development, and makes projects vulnerable to better-funded competitors.

**The Asymmetric Advantage:**
- **Performance Supremacy:** Native Rust performance that's economically irrational to replicate in forks
- **Community Gravity:** Network effects through shared architectural insights
- **Integration Depth:** Deep Cargo ecosystem integration creates switching costs
- **Update Velocity:** Rapid iteration through simplified architecture

### The 80/20 OSS Optimization Framework

**Core 20% That Delivers 80% of Value:**

**1. Performance Supremacy Engine**
```rust
Parseltongue {
    parser: RustParser,           // 100k LOC in <5 seconds
    query_engine: QueryEngine,   // Sub-millisecond responses
    visualizer: GraphViz,        // Instant dependency visualization
    llm_client: LLMClient,       // 90% token cost reduction
}
```

**2. Three-Command Simplicity**
```bash
parseltongue ingest .              # Build ISG from current directory
parseltongue ask "your question"    # Natural language queries
parseltongue show dependencies     # Visualize relationships
```

**3. Rust Ecosystem Deep Integration**
- **Cargo Harmony:** Understand `Cargo.toml`, feature flags, workspace structure
- **Toolchain Symbiosis:** Seamless rustfmt, clippy, cargo test integration
- **Type System Awareness:** Leverage Rust's ownership and trait system intelligence

**Complexity Traps to Eliminate:**
- **Plugin Architecture:** Fragmentation risk, maintenance nightmare
- **Configuration Systems:** Decision fatigue, unnecessary complexity
- **Multiple Model Support:** Support overhead, user confusion
- **Advanced Customization:** Fork encouragement, feature bloat

### The Low-Token-Cost Contribution Accelerator

**Traditional AI-Assisted OSS Problems:**
```
Traditional Approach:
- Ask AI: "Help me contribute to project X" ‚Üí 10,000 tokens (generic response)
- Result: Low-quality contribution, $50-100 cost per PR

Parseltongue Approach:
- Ingest project X ‚Üí ISG generated (one-time cost)
- Ask: "Where should I add this feature?" ‚Üí 200 tokens (targeted response)
- Result: High-quality contribution, $1-2 cost per PR
```

**The Economic Multiplier:**
- **Token Reduction:** 50x lower token consumption through targeted context
