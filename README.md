# Transfiguration

Repository for code references, ideations, and documentation.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main sections:

### =Ú Documentation (`docs/`)
Contains all documentation, analysis, and reference materials:
- IDE analysis and research
- Performance studies
- Architecture documentation
- Technical specifications
- Research findings
- Code examples and references

See `docs/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` for a complete classification of all files.

### =à Scripts (`scripts/`)
Utility scripts and automation tools:
- `classify_files.py` - Automatically classifies and catalogs markdown/text files

### =Ê File Classification

All markdown and text files have been automatically classified and cataloged:
- **Table of Contents**: `docs/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md`
- **JSON Data**: `docs/file_classifications.json`

Run `python3 scripts/classify_files.py` from the repository root to regenerate classifications.

## Quick Start

1. Browse documentation in `docs/`
2. Check `docs/TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` for a categorized overview
3. Use scripts in `scripts/` for automation tasks

## Note on Rust Code

This repository contains Rust code primarily as reference material and examples, organized within the documentation structure. The focus is on analysis, documentation, and ideation rather than production code.
