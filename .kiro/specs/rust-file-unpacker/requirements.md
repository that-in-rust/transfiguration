# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a security-first Rust command-line tool that can safely and recursively unpack .deb files (specifically Kiro202509172055-distro-linux-x64.deb) to maximum depth for comprehensive analysis. The tool is designed for developers, security researchers, and DevSecOps teams who need complete visibility into package contents without executing code, addressing critical gaps in existing tooling like `dpkg-deb`. This is not merely an unpacker but a zero-trust analysis engine for modern software supply chain validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to safely unpack the Kiro202509172055-distro-linux-x64.deb file to maximum depth with zero-trust security controls, so that I can analyze all nested package contents without risk of system compromise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool processes a .deb file THEN the system SHALL validate it as a proper ar archive with !<arch> magic string
2. WHEN the ar archive is parsed THEN the system SHALL enforce the required member order: debian-binary, control.tar.*, data.tar.*
3. WHEN debian-binary is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate it contains version "2.0" format
4. WHEN nested archives are discovered THEN the system SHALL recursively unpack them using streaming I/O pipeline
5. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL generate a structured JSON manifest with complete file inventory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevSecOps engineer, I want the tool to handle comprehensive format support with streaming decompression, so that I can process large .deb packages efficiently in CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compressed tar archives are encountered THEN the system SHALL support gzip, xz, zstd, bzip2, and lzma formats using streaming decompression
2. WHEN file types are detected THEN the system SHALL use magic-byte detection rather than file extensions for security
3. WHEN decompression occurs THEN the system SHALL use streaming readers to maintain memory usage below 150MB peak
4. WHEN tar archives are processed THEN the system SHALL extract all entries while performing path sanitization
5. WHEN unsupported formats are found THEN the system SHALL log warnings, record in JSON manifest, and continue processing
6. WHEN cycle detection is needed THEN the system SHALL use BLAKE3 hashing to prevent infinite loops from self-referential archives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want robust path traversal protection and secure file extraction, so that I can safely analyze untrusted .deb packages without system compromise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file path is processed THEN the system SHALL use openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH) on Linux to confine extraction to target directory
2. WHEN path traversal attempts are detected THEN the system SHALL reject paths containing ".." or absolute paths and log security violations
3. WHEN output directory is specified THEN the system SHALL create it securely and validate all extracted paths remain within it
4. WHEN filename collisions occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with numeric suffixes
5. WHEN symlinks are encountered THEN the system SHALL validate they don't escape the extraction directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a CI/CD engineer, I want structured logging and machine-readable output, so that I can integrate the tool into automated security scanning pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool runs THEN the system SHALL use tracing framework for structured logging with spans and events
2. WHEN progress reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate indicatif progress bars with tracing for flicker-free output
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL output a comprehensive JSON manifest with file counts, sizes, errors, and archive lineage
4. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed operation-by-operation logging for troubleshooting
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use thiserror for typed errors and anyhow for contextual error propagation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security team lead, I want comprehensive resource exhaustion protection and DoS prevention, so that the tool can safely process potentially malicious archives in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recursion depth is tracked THEN the system SHALL enforce a default limit of 16 levels (configurable via --depth-limit flag)
2. WHEN file sizes are processed THEN the system SHALL implement configurable limits and warn users of extremely large files
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL maintain peak usage below 150MB regardless of archive size
4. WHEN corrupted archives are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully, skip problematic entries, and continue processing
5. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log detailed warnings and allow graceful termination

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want high-performance parallel extraction with a clean modular architecture, so that the tool can process large packages efficiently and be reusable across different applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is architected THEN the system SHALL use a two-crate design with library (my-deb-tool-lib) and CLI (my-deb-tool-cli) separation
2. WHEN file extraction occurs THEN the system SHALL use parallel I/O workers with bounded channels for backpressure control
3. WHEN throughput is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 10,000 files per second on modern NVMe storage
4. WHEN the tool is built THEN the system SHALL target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl for static binary distribution
5. WHEN CLI arguments are processed THEN the system SHALL support --out-dir, --depth-limit, --jobs, and --verbose flags using clap
