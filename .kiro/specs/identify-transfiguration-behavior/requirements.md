# Requirements Document: Identify Transfiguration Behavior

## Introduction

This feature involves **Phase 1: Discovery & Documentation** of Kiro.dev behaviors to enable future transfiguration from Electron to Rust/WASM architecture. The primary goal is to systematically extract, document, and analyze all discoverable behaviors from the extracted Kiro application files to create a comprehensive behavioral specification.

**Phase 1 Goal:** Create a complete behavioral documentation of Kiro.dev through static analysis of extracted files, establishing the specification foundation for future Rust/WASM transfiguration phases.

**Key Insights from Kiro Analysis:**
- **VS Code Fork**: Kiro is built as a fork of VS Code OSS (version 1.103.2) with custom branding and AI features
- **Electron Architecture**: Uses Electron with an `app.asar` archive containing the application logic
- **Extension System**: Uses Open VSX Registry instead of Microsoft's marketplace for extensions
- **AI Integration**: Includes built-in Kiro Agent extension for AI-powered development assistance
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Electron's overhead and JavaScript execution can be addressed by using Rust/WASM
- **Security Model**: Limited sandboxing compared to native applications, opportunity for WASM improvement

**Extracted Kiro Files Location:** `/Users/neetipatni/Desktop/extracted_kiro`

**Architecture Foundation:**
- **Base**: VS Code OSS 1.103.2 (not Eclipse Theia)
- **Package Manager**: Uses Open VSX Registry for extensions
- **Core Dependencies**: Monaco editor, xterm.js, vscode-textmate, vscode-oniguruma
- **AI Components**: Custom Kiro Agent extension with AWS integration

## Architecture Insights from Kiro Analysis

### Key Findings from Kiro.dev Reverse Engineering
Based on our comprehensive analysis of the Kiro.dev application package, we identified several architectural patterns and opportunities for improvement:

#### VS Code OSS Fork Analysis
- **Foundation**: Kiro is a direct fork of VS Code OSS 1.103.2, not Eclipse Theia
- **Architecture**: Electron-based with standard VS Code extension system
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Electron's overhead and JavaScript execution can be slow for compute-intensive operations
- **Memory Usage**: Electron applications typically consume 100-200MB+ of memory for the runtime alone
- **Extension Marketplace**: Uses Open VSX Registry instead of Microsoft's marketplace
- **AI Integration**: Custom Kiro Agent extension provides AI-powered development assistance
- **Extracted Structure**: Full Kiro application extracted showing:
  - Standard VS Code architecture with Monaco editor, xterm.js, language servers
  - Custom branding and configuration (product.json, package.json)
  - Built-in extensions including Kiro Agent and Microsoft debugging tools
  - AWS-specific integrations and telemetry

#### Opportunity for Rust/WASM Improvement
- **Performance Gains**: Rust/WASM can provide 2-10x performance improvements for parsing, analysis, and data processing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and manual memory management can reduce memory usage by 50-80%
- **Security Benefits**: Rust's memory safety eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, use-after-free)
- **Cross-Platform**: Single Rust codebase can target native platforms and web via WASM

#### Rust/WASM vs VS Code OSS Strategy
- **Editor Core**: Continue using Monaco editor for the text editing experience (proven and feature-rich)
- **Architecture Shift**: Replace Electron with Rust/WASM + Tauri for native performance and security

- **AI Integration**: Implement AI request handling and response processing in Rust for better performance
- **File System**: Use Rust for file operations, project management, and workspace handling
- **Marketplace**: Support Open VSX Registry like Kiro, avoiding Microsoft marketplace dependencies

#### Security Model Improvements
- **Sandboxing**: WASM provides better sandboxing than Electron's renderer processes
- **API Security**: Rust's type system can enforce API contracts and prevent injection attacks
- **Credential Management**: Use Rust cryptographic libraries for secure credential storage
- **Code Analysis**: Rust parsers can safely analyze untrusted code without security risks

#### Deployment Strategy
- **Web-First**: Primary deployment as a web application using WASM
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Native desktop apps using Tauri (Rust-based Electron alternative)
- **Offline Capability**: WASM enables full offline functionality without Node.js runtime
- **Distribution**: Single binary distribution without complex dependency management
